*   Obey all applicable laws and institutional rules.

## Why This Path?

### Why Python?
Python is a dominant language in the AI/ML community for several reasons:

*   **Widely Used:** It's the most popular language in AI/ML, boasting a vast ecosystem of libraries and tools.
*   **Beginner-Friendly:** It's one of the easiest coding languages to learn, with a clear and readable syntax.
*   **Versatility:** Python [noun for versatile, capable of doing various things] is capable of handling a wide variety of tasks, from web development to data analysis and machine learning.

### Why This Class?
*   **Focused Learning:** This is a concentrated course targeting data science, machine learning, and AI applications.
*   **Practical Application:** The course is not focused solely on abstract data analysis theory; we aim to foster your understanding through practical application.
    *   !!! quote "Insight"
        Many introductory materials can be too vacuous [empty] to foster deep understanding. We aim for practical insights and hands-on experience.
*   **Background Knowledge:** This course intends to be an informational resource, providing you with essential background knowledge.
    *   !!! info "Design Philosophy"
        Every design feature in a programming language or tool often arises from a specific need or problem. You will learn the key features of Python (what many call "pythonic" style).

## General Concepts of a Programming Language

!!! info "Key Terminology"
    Understanding these basic terms is crucial when learning any programming language:
    *   **Characters, letters, etc.:** The fundamental units (like letters, numbers, symbols) that form code, carrying information.
    *   **Editors (software):** Applications where you write your code (e.g., VS Code, Notepad++, Sublime Text).
    *   **Compiler/Interpreter (software):** Programs that translate your human-readable code into something computers can understand (machine code). Python uses an interpreter.
    *   **Environment:** The specific setup (including the interpreter and necessary libraries) where your code runs.
    *   **Environment Manager (software):** Tools like Anaconda or Python's built-in `venv` that help create, manage, and isolate different Python environments to prevent conflicts.

!!! question "Exercise: Your First Steps"
    1.  List some code editors that you have used or are familiar with.
    2.  Write your first line of Python code (in this class) in an editor. Try this:
        ```python
        print("Hello Python! ")
        ```
    3.  Do you know the general process for installing software on your computer? (This is a general skill check.)  

## Setting Up Your Python Environment

For this course, we'll primarily use:

*   **VS Code:** A lightweight yet powerful and highly extensible code editor.
*   **Anaconda:** A distribution of Python and R for scientific computing and data science. It simplifies package management and deployment.

You can download these tools from their official websites:

*   VS Code: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
*   Anaconda: [https://www.anaconda.com/download](https://www.anaconda.com/download) (or anaconda.com and navigate to downloads)

### Working with VS Code
1.  Install VS Code if you haven't already.
2.  Open VS Code and install these essential extensions from the Extensions Marketplace (usually an icon on the left sidebar or accessed via `Ctrl+Shift+X`):
    *   **Python** (by Microsoft): Provides rich support for Python development.
    *   **Jupyter** (by Microsoft): Enables working with Jupyter Notebooks within VS Code.

!!! question "Exercise: VS Code Familiarization"
    1.  Launch VS Code. Take a moment to look at its layout (the arrangement of different panels like the editor, sidebar, terminal panel, etc.). What do you observe?
    2.  Find the icon for managing extensions. How would you search for and install an extension?  

### Working with Anaconda
Anaconda is different from many GUI-based software applications you might have used. A primary way to interact with its environment management features is through its **Command Line Interface (CLI)**.

!!! info "Command Line Interface (CLI)"
    A CLI is a text-based interface where you type commands to interact with your computer or specific software (like Anaconda), rather than clicking buttons in a graphical interface. On Windows, this is often the "Anaconda Prompt." On macOS and Linux, it's your standard terminal after `conda` has been initialized.

!!! question "Exercise: Opening Anaconda Prompt/Terminal"
    1.  How do you open the Anaconda Prompt (if you're on Windows) or a terminal session where `conda` commands are available (macOS/Linux)?
    2.  What do you observe when you open it? What information does the prompt display?  

### Anaconda Environment Management
Managing separate environments is crucial in Python development, especially in data science, to avoid package conflicts and ensure project reproducibility. Here are some basic `conda` commands:

*   **Create a new environment:**
    This command creates a new, isolated environment named `MLPython`. Anaconda will solve for dependencies and create the environment.
    ```bash
    (base) C:\Users\glma>conda create -n MLPython
    ```
    You will likely be prompted to proceed with the installation of default packages (`y/n`). Type `y` and press Enter.

*   **Activate an environment:**
    This command switches your CLI session from the current environment (e.g., `base`) into the `MLPython` environment. The command prompt will usually change to reflect the active environment.
    ```bash
    (base) C:\Users\glma>conda activate MLPython
    (MLPython) C:\Users\glma>
    ```

!!! note "Prompt Change"
    Notice how `(base)` in the command prompt typically changes to `(MLPython)` (or whatever you named your environment). This indicates that the `MLPython` environment is now active, and any Python or package commands will operate within this environment.

### Running Python Scripts
Once your environment is active and Python is installed within it (it usually is by default when creating a conda environment, or you can specify a Python version during creation), you can run Python scripts (`.py` files).

*   **Example:**
    To run a Python script, you use the `python` command followed by the path to your script.
    ```bash
    (MLPython) C:\Users\glma>python "F:\2025S Python\00-introduction\test.txt"
    ```

!!! note "Executing Scripts"
    Typically, Python scripts have a `.py` extension (e.g., `test.py`). If `test.txt` in the example above contains Python code, it's standard practice to rename it to `test.py` for clarity and convention. However, the Python interpreter can technically attempt to execute any file passed to it; whether it runs successfully depends on the file's content being valid Python code.

!!! warning "Common Mistakes When Running Scripts"
    *   **Incorrect Path:** Ensure the file path is accurate and complete. If the path contains spaces, enclose it in double quotes.
    *   **Wrong Environment:** Make sure you are in the correct `conda` environment where Python and any necessary packages for the script are installed.
    *   **File Not Found:** Double-check for typos in the filename or path.

### Installing Packages: `conda` vs. `pip`

When you need to add new libraries (also known as packages) to your Python environment, you'll primarily use either `conda install` or `pip install`.

!!! info "`conda` vs. `pip` for Package Installation"
    *   **`conda install <package-name>`**:
        *   Installs packages from Anaconda repositories (like `pkgs/main`, `conda-forge`, etc.).
        *   Manages not only Python packages but also Python itself and even non-Python dependencies (e.g., C libraries).
        *   Known for its robust dependency resolution, making it very effective at handling complex dependencies and creating consistent environments, especially for data science packages (NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, scikit-learn, etc.).
        *   Generally the recommended way to install packages when working within an Anaconda environment.
    *   **`pip install <package-name>`**:
        *   Installs packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI), which is the official third-party software repository for Python.
        *   `pip` is the standard package installer for Python and is included with most Python installations.
        *   Can be used within conda environments. It's often advisable to try `conda install` first for a package; if it's not available through conda channels or if you need a very specific version from PyPI, then `pip install` is a good alternative.

We will discuss package management in more detail as the course progresses. For now, it's important to be aware that both `conda` and `pip` are common tools for installing packages into your Python environments.

# Python for AI: Environment Setup and Applications

## Setting up a Python Environment

### Installing Packages: `conda` vs `pip`

When managing your Python projects, especially in AI and Machine Learning, you'll frequently need to install external libraries. The two most popular package managers are `conda` and `pip`.

!!! info "Choosing Between `conda` and `pip`"
    *   **`conda`** is a package and environment manager. It can install Python packages as well as non-Python software. It's particularly good at handling complex dependencies and creating isolated environments, which is crucial for reproducible research. `conda` often installs pre-compiled binaries, which can be faster and easier for packages with complex build requirements (e.g., NumPy, SciPy).
    *   **`pip`** is the Python Package Installer. It installs packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI) and other indexes. It's generally used for Python-specific packages and is often used within `conda` environments for packages not available through `conda` channels.

For example, to install the `numpy` package using `conda`, you would open your terminal (like Anaconda Prompt or your system terminal if `conda` is in your PATH) and type:

```bash
conda install numpy
```

### Working with VS Code

Once your environment is set up and necessary packages are installed, you can start writing and executing Python code. Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a popular editor for Python development.

1.  **Write your code:** Open a `.py` file or a Jupyter Notebook within VS Code.
2.  **Run (execute) the code:** VS Code offers several ways to run Python code, including running the entire file or selected lines.

Here's a simple example:

```python
sentence = "Hello Python!"
print(sentence)
```

!!! question "Exercise: Printing a Message"
    1. How did you print “Hello Python!” in your environment?  
    2. If you tried different methods (e.g., running a script file vs. using an interactive Python console), what differences did you observe?  

## What We Can Do with Python: AI Examples

Python's extensive libraries make it a powerful tool for various AI tasks. Let's look at a few examples.

### Example: Speech Recognition

We can use the `whisper` library from OpenAI to transcribe audio files.

!!! note "Installation"
    To use `whisper`, you will likely need to install `ffmpeg` and the `openai-whisper` package. The original course note suggests installing both from `conda-forge`:
    ```bash
    conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg openai-whisper
    ```
    Alternatively, you can install `ffmpeg` using `conda` and `openai-whisper` using `pip` (which is commonly recommended by OpenAI):
    ```bash
    conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg
    pip install openai-whisper
    ```

Here's how you can transcribe an audio file:

```python
import whisper

# Load the base model
model = whisper.load_model("base")

# Transcribe an audio file (e.g., audio.m4a)
# Ensure the audio file 'audio.m4a' is in the same directory or provide the full path
result = model.transcribe(audio="audio.m4a", fp16=False)

# Print the transcribed text
# The result is a dictionary; the transcribed text is in the "text" key.
print(result["text"])
```

!!! info "About `fp16=False`"
    The `fp16=False` argument in `model.transcribe` indicates that 16-bit floating-point precision should not be used for the transcription. While `fp16` (half-precision) can speed up inference on compatible GPUs and reduce memory usage, it might not be supported on all hardware (like many CPUs) or could lead to slight differences in precision. Setting it to `False` ensures broader compatibility, especially when running on a CPU.

### Example: Picture Recognition (OCR)

`easyocr` is a Python library that allows you to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on images, extracting printed or handwritten text.

!!! note "Installation"
    You can install `easyocr` using `pip`:
    ```bash
    pip install easyocr
    ```

Here's an example of reading text from an image:

```python
import easyocr

# Initialize the reader for English, specifying to run on CPU
# You can add other languages e.g., ['ch_sim', 'en'] for Chinese and English
reader = easyocr.Reader(['en'], gpu=False)

# Read text from an image file
# Replace 'F:/2025S Python/00 -introduction/good.png' with the actual path to your image
# detail=0 returns only the text, not bounding box coordinates or confidence scores
image_path = 'F:/2025S Python/00 -introduction/good.png'
result = reader.readtext(image_path, detail=0)

# Print the recognized text (result is a list of strings)
print(result)
```

### Example: Picture Generation

We can use the OpenAI API with the `openai` Python package to generate images from text prompts using models like DALL·E.

!!! note "Installation and Setup"
    First, install the `openai` library:
    ```bash
    pip install openai
    ```
    You'll also need an OpenAI API key. It's best practice to set this as an environment variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

```python
from openai import OpenAI
import os

# It's recommended to set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable.
# The OpenAI library will automatically pick it up.
# Example: OPENAI_API_KEY = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
# If OPENAI_API_KEY is not set in your environment, you must pass it explicitly:
# client = OpenAI(api_key="your_actual_api_key_here")
# However, avoid hardcoding keys in shared scripts.
client = OpenAI() # Assumes OPENAI_API_KEY is set in the environment

response = client.images.generate(
  model="dall-e-2",
  prompt="driving in Ames in autumn",
  size="1024x1024",
  quality="standard",
  n=1
)

image_url = response.data[0].url
print(image_url)
```

!!! warning "API Key Security"
    Never hardcode your API keys directly into your scripts if you plan to share or version control your code. Use environment variables or a dedicated secrets management system.

!!! question "Exercise: AI Task Workflow"
    1. Based on the previous three examples (speech recognition, picture recognition, picture generation), can you summarize the general procedure for working on an AI task in Python?  
    2. Where do the "models" (like `whisper.load_model("base")` or the `dall-e-2` model) typically come from?

Streaming response: # Understanding Iterables and Iterators in Python

This chapter delves into the fundamental concepts of iterables and iterators in Python, which are crucial for handling collections of data and managing iteration processes efficiently.

## What are Iterables?

Loosely speaking, you can think of **iterables** as if they are a specific "type" of object in Python. More precisely, iterables refer to any Python objects that share common behaviors enabling them to be iterated over—that is, processed item by item in a sequence.

### Key Properties of Iterables

Iterables are defined by several key characteristics and behaviors:

#### Compatibility with For Loops

A primary characteristic of iterables is that they can all be passed to a `for` loop. This aligns with their name: they are objects *able* to be *iterated* over.

```python
# Conceptual representation of iterating over an iterable
for item in an_iterable:
    # process item
    pass
```

#### Usable with the `iter()` Function

Only iterables can be passed as an argument to Python's built-in `iter()` function. This function is essential for obtaining an iterator from an iterable object.

!!! info "The `iter()` Function"
    The `iter()` function is a built-in Python utility. When called with an iterable argument, it returns an iterator object. If the argument is not iterable, `iter()` will raise a `TypeError`.

Consider the following example:
```python
a = [1, 2, 3]  # A list is an iterable
b = 1          # An integer is not an iterable

# Correctly obtains an iterator from the list 'a'
iterator_a = iter(a)
print(f"Iterator from list: {iterator_a}")

# Attempting to get an iterator from 'b' will cause an error
# iter(b) # errorIterables
```

!!! warning "TypeError with Non-Iterables"
    Calling `iter()` on an object that is not iterable, such as an integer, will result in a `TypeError`. For instance, `iter(1)` will fail, indicating that 'int' objects are not iterable.

#### The `__iter__` Method: The Defining Feature

The special characteristic that formally defines an object as iterable is the presence of a method named `__iter__()`. In Python, everything is an object, and objects encapsulate data (attributes) and functionality (methods). You can inspect an object's available attributes and methods using the `dir()` function.

The defining property of an iterable is that it implements the `__iter__()` method. When you call `iter(some_object)`, Python internally executes `some_object.__iter__()`. This `__iter__()` method is responsible for returning an iterator object.

```python
a = [1, 2, 3]  # Our example list

# Using dir(a) will show '__iter__' among its methods
# print(dir(a))

# These two operations are effectively equivalent:
iterator_from_function = iter(a)
iterator_from_method = a.__iter__()

print(f"Iterator via iter(a): {iterator_from_function}")
print(f"Iterator via a.__iter__(): {iterator_from_method}")
```

!!! note "Dunder Methods"
    Methods like `__iter__` (with double underscores at the beginning and end) are often called "dunder" methods or special methods. Python uses these methods to implement various protocols and behaviors, such as iteration, string representation (`__str__`), and arithmetic operations (`__add__`).

#### For Loops and `__getitem__`: An Alternative Iteration Mechanism

It's important to note a specific behavior of `for` loops in Python related to objects that might not be "formally" iterable via `__iter__()`. If an object does not define an `__iter__()` method but *does* implement the `__getitem__()` method (which allows access to elements via an index, like `object[0]`, `object[1]`, etc.), a `for` loop can still iterate over it. The loop will attempt to fetch items by index, starting from 0, until an `IndexError` is raised, signaling the end of the sequence.

!!! info "Modern Iteration Protocol"
    While the `__getitem__` mechanism provides a way to iterate over sequence-like objects, the standard and more explicit way to define an object as iterable in modern Python is by implementing the `__iter__()` method.

## Iterables vs. Iterators

While closely related, iterables and iterators play distinct roles in Python's iteration model.

### Defining Iterators

**Iterators** form a specialized subset of iterables. This means that an iterator object must *also* implement the `__iter__()` method. Conventionally, an iterator’s `__iter__()` method returns `self` (the iterator object itself).

However, the crucial feature that distinguishes an iterator from a general iterable is the mandatory presence of another special method: `__next__()`.

!!! note "Key Distinction: Iterable vs. Iterator"
    *   **Iterable**: An object capable of producing an iterator. It must implement the `__iter__()` method. Examples: lists, strings, tuples.
    *   **Iterator**: An object that produces the next value in a sequence upon request. It must implement both `__iter__()` (usually returning `self`) and `__next__()`.

In essence, an iterator *is* an iterable, but an iterable is not necessarily an iterator until its `__iter__()` method is called.

### The Role of `__next__`

The `__next__()` method is the engine of an iterator. It's responsible for returning the subsequent item in the iteration sequence. When you use the built-in `next(my_iterator)` function, Python internally calls `my_iterator.__next__()`.

*   If there are more items available, `__next__()` returns the next item.
*   If the iteration has exhausted all items, the `__next__()` method must raise a `StopIteration` exception. This exception is the standard signal to constructs like `for` loops that the iteration is complete.

## The Importance of Iterables and Iterators

Understanding and utilizing iterables and iterators is fundamental to writing efficient, idiomatic Python code.

### Why Use Iterables?

Iterables are pervasive throughout Python. Many built-in data types, including lists, tuples, strings, dictionaries (which iterate over keys by default), sets, and file objects, are inherently iterable. For most common tasks, you don't need to create iterables from scratch, as Python's standard library provides a rich set.

The primary purpose of an iterable, in the context of the iteration protocol, is to provide an iterator when requested. This is typically achieved by calling the `iter()` function on the iterable, which in turn calls its `__iter__()` method.

### The Power of Iterators: Lazy Evaluation

The core reason for the distinction and existence of iterators is to enable **lazy evaluation**. Iterators do not generate or load all their values into memory at once. Instead, they produce values one at a time, and only when explicitly requested (e.g., by a `for` loop calling `next()` implicitly, or a direct call to `next(my_iterator)`).

!!! quote "Insight: On-Demand Processing"
    We need iterators because we often don’t want Python to do all the work of producing sequence items immediately. We want it to do what is needed, only when we tell it to do so. This "on-demand" or "just-in-time" value generation is key to their utility.

This lazy evaluation characteristic offers significant advantages:

*   **Memory Efficiency**: Iterators allow you to work with data sequences that are too large to fit entirely into memory. For example, processing lines from a multi-gigabyte file.
*   **Infinite Sequences**: Iterators can represent sequences that are conceptually infinite (e.g., a generator function yielding an endless series of numbers).
*   **Computational Efficiency**: If a sequence requires complex computation to produce its items, an iterator ensures that computation only occurs for items that are actually accessed. If you only need the first few items, you avoid the cost of generating the rest.

Streaming response: # Chapter 1: Python Basics

## Introduction

Welcome to the basics of Python programming for AI. In this chapter, you will learn about:

*   Very elementary Python theory.
*   Fundamental building blocks of Python programs.
*   Commonly used functions: it's important to memorize their names, understand their parameters, and be able to interpret their output.

!!! quote "An Analogy: Programming as Construction"
    If we liken a program to a building, variables are the foundational blocks. The syntax of the programming language then dictates how these blocks are assembled to form walls. Different programs, therefore, are simply different architectural designs for constructing these walls.

## Variables and Names

Programming can be seen as an art of putting mathematical ideas into practice. A core concept in mathematics, and subsequently in programming, is abstraction. The most elementary form of abstraction is the variable.

Think back to your math education:

*   In primary school, you learned to count: 1, 2, 3.
*   In middle school, you were introduced to using symbols like $x$ to represent a generic or representative number. This single letter $x$ could stand for 1, 2, 100, or any other numerical value, showcasing its versatility.

In Python, we often refer to these symbolic representations as **names**. When we create a variable, our goal is for this name to represent a specific value. Python facilitates this by:
1.  Allocating a chunk of memory to store the value.
2.  Binding this value (and its associated memory location) to the name we provide.
(Imagine a visual representation: the name is like a label pointing to a box in memory that holds the actual data.)

### Illustrative Example: Variable Assignment and Memory

Let's look at a quick example of how variables (names) work in Python, particularly concerning their memory addresses.

```python
# Quick verification of variable assignment and identity
a = 1
print(id(a))  # Shows the memory address of the object 'a' refers to

b = a
print(id(b))  # 'b' now refers to the same object as 'a'

# If id(b) doesn't appear as a typical memory address,
# we can format it as a hexadecimal number.
print(f"{id(b):02X}")
```

In the code snippet above, we utilized a few key Python features:

*   **`print()` function**: This function is used to display the content or value of what is passed to it.
*   **`id()` function**: This function returns the unique identifier (often the memory address) of an object.
*   **f-string formatting**: By prefixing a string with `f` (e.g., `f"..."`), we can embed expressions inside string literals by placing them inside curly braces `{}`. Here, `f"{id(b):02X}"` formats the ID as a hexadecimal number.

!!! question "Exercise: Working with Names and Values"
    1.  Create a name-value pair where the name is `person_name` and the value is the string `"Alice"`.
    2.  Print the value associated with `person_name`.
    3.  Re-bind the `person_name` variable to a new string value, `"Bob"`.
    4.  Using an f-string, print a sentence that includes the current value of `person_name`, for example: "The current name is Bob."  

## Names, Objects, and Memory

!!! info "Fundamental Concepts in Python"
    Two crucial ideas in Python are:
    *   "Names refer to objects."
    *   "Everything in Python is an object."

While we won't delve into a formal introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts just yet, we can understand **objects** as chunks of memory that have specific, defined structures.

What is special about an object? An object comprises its:

*   **Identity**: A unique identifier for the object (e.g., its memory address, obtainable via `id()`).
*   **Type**: Defines the possible values and operations for the object (e.g., integer, string, list; obtainable via `type()`).
*   **Value**: The actual data stored in the object.

!!! question "Exercise: Features of an Object"
    Based on our discussion:
    1.  Can you summarize some key features of an object in Python?
    2.  Hint: We've learned that "everything in Python is an object." What common characteristics do all objects share?  

### Memory Layout

The internal structure of an object, which defines how its data is stored within its allocated chunk of memory, is referred to as its **memory layout**. This layout dictates how the memory is organized to hold the object's data.

To get an idea of the size in memory an object occupies, you can use the `sys` module:

```python
import sys

a = 10
print(sys.getsizeof(a)) # Size of integer object 'a' in bytes

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(sys.getsizeof(my_list)) # Size of list object 'my_list' in bytes
```

## Object Types

The concept of "types" in Python is extensive. Each object has a type, which determines what kind of data it can hold and what operations can be performed on it. For comprehensive details, refer to the [official Python documentation on standard types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html).

Let's look at a few examples of different data types:

```python
a = 1        # Integer
b = 2.0      # Floating-point number
c = 3.14 - 5j # Complex number
cond = True  # Boolean
```

!!! question "Exercise: Checking Object Types"
    Using the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `cond` from the example above:
    1.  Use the built-in `type()` function to determine and print the type of each variable.  

### Simple Types: Boolean

The Boolean type (`bool`) is a fundamental simple type in Python. It has two possible values: `True` and `False`.

Let's investigate Booleans, and in doing so, we'll introduce a useful function: `isinstance()`. This function checks if an object is an instance of a particular class or type.

Consider the following:
```python
a = 1
cond = True # From our previous example

# Check if 'a' is an integer
print(isinstance(a, int))

# Check if 'a' is of its own type
print(isinstance(a, type(a)))

# Investigate Boolean's relationship with integers
print(isinstance(cond, bool))
print(isinstance(cond, int)) # Is True also considered an integer?
print(cond + 1)              # What happens if we perform arithmetic?
```

!!! note "Booleans as Integers"
    In Python, `True` is treated as `1` and `False` is treated as `0` in many numerical contexts. This is why `isinstance(True, int)` evaluates to `True` and arithmetic operations like `True + 1` (which results in `2`) are possible.

!!! question "Exercise: Exploring Booleans and `isinstance`"
    1.  We saw that `True` can behave like the integer `1`. Investigate `False`:
        *   What is the result of `isinstance(False, int)`?
        *   What is the result of `False + 1`?
    2.  Experiment with the `isinstance()` function using various other data types (e.g., float, string) and type checks. Do you find any interesting behaviors or relationships between types?
    3.  Search the web for the official Python documentation for the `isinstance()` function and read about its capabilities and parameters.  

### Complex Types (Collection Types)

So far, we've looked at simple types that generally represent a single value (like an integer or a boolean). Python also offers **complex types**, often called collection or container types, which can group multiple values together.

For instance, drawing an analogy from mathematics:

*   `1` is a number.
*   `2` is a number.
*   `{1, 2}` is a set, which is a collection of numbers.

In Python, common categories of types that hold multiple items include:

*   **Sequences**: Ordered collections like lists, tuples, and strings.
*   **Mappings**: Collections of key-value pairs, like dictionaries.
*   (Strings are technically sequences of characters but are often discussed as a fundamental type on their own.)

#### Sequences: Lists and Tuples

Among the most frequently encountered sequence types are **lists** and **tuples**. Both are ordered collections of items. A primary way to create them is by enumerating their elements:

*   **Lists** are created using square brackets `[]` and are mutable (their contents can be changed after creation).
*   **Tuples** are created using parentheses `()` and are immutable (their contents cannot be changed after creation).

```python
# Creating a list
my_list = [1, 2, 3, "hello", 4.5]
print(my_list)

# Creating a tuple
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, "world", 6.7)
print(my_tuple)
```

!!! question "Exercise: Working with Lists"
    1.  Create a list containing a few items of different types (e.g., numbers, strings). Print the entire list.
    2.  Access and print a single element from the list using its index. (Remember that indexing starts at 0).
    3.  Create a list containing the numbers from 1 to 100.
        *   Hint: You can do this manually for a few numbers, or think if there's a Python function that can help generate a sequence of numbers, which can then be converted to a list (e.g., `range()` and `list()`).  

!!! question "Exercise: Working with Tuples"
    1.  Create a tuple containing a few items. Print the entire tuple.
    2.  Access and print a single element from the tuple using its index.
    3.  Create a tuple containing the numbers from 1 to 100.
        *   Hint: Similar to lists, consider using `range()` and `tuple()`.

Streaming response: # Understanding Python Sequences

This section delves into Python's sequence types, focusing on lists and tuples, their methods, and the powerful slicing mechanism. We'll also briefly touch upon other sequence types like arrays and deques.

## Lists and Tuples: Fundamental Sequences

Lists and tuples are fundamental ordered collections in Python. While both store sequences of items, they have key differences, primarily concerning mutability.

!!! question "Introductory Tuple Exercises"
    1. Try to print one element of a tuple you create.  
    2. Create a tuple containing 100 numbers, from 1 to 100.  

### List and Tuple Methods

Lists and tuples come with built-in operations. For operations specific to an object (like a particular list or tuple), we use "methods". Methods are like functions tied to an object.

!!! warning "Impact of Methods on Callers"
    Many list methods modify the list directly (in-place) because lists are mutable. Tuple methods, since tuples are immutable, will not change the tuple itself but might return new tuples or values.

Key operations and methods include:

*   **`append()` (list only):** Adds a single element to the end of a list.
*   **`extend()` (list only):** Adds all elements from an iterable (like another list or tuple) to the end of a list.
*   **`pop()` (list only):** Removes and returns an element at a given index (default is the last element).
*   **The `+` operator:** Concatenates sequences. For lists, it creates a new list. For tuples, it creates a new tuple.

### Modifying Element Values

A crucial distinction between lists and tuples lies in their mutability. You can change elements in a list after it's created, but you cannot change elements in a tuple.

!!! question "Modifying List vs. Tuple Elements"
    1. Using a list `l` and a tuple `t` that you have created:  
        *   Set the second element of `l` to the value `-1`. Observe that this is possible.  
        *   Attempt to set the second element of `t` to the value `-1`. Observe the error, demonstrating tuple immutability.  
    2. Consider or research how these operations (or lack thereof for tuples) affect the memory layout. (Hint: List modification happens in-place; tuple "modification" would require creating a new tuple).  

### Similarities and Comparisons

Let's explore how lists and tuples behave with common operations:

**Indexing and Assignment:**
Lists are mutable, so you can change their elements. Tuples are immutable.

```python
# Initializing a list and a tuple
l = [1, 2, 3]
t = (4, 5, 6)

# Accessing elements (works for both)
print(l[0])  # Output: 1
print(t[0])  # Output: 4

# Modifying an element
l[0] = 100  # This is ✓ (valid for lists)
print(l)     # Output: [100, 2, 3]

# Attempting to modify a tuple element
# t[0] = 100  # This is ✗ (invalid for tuples - will raise TypeError)
```

**Deletion:**
You can delete elements from a list. This is not possible for tuples.

```python
l = [1, 2, 3]
t = (4, 5, 6)

del l[1]  # ✓ (valid for lists)
print(l)   # Output: [1, 3]

# del t[1]  # ✗ (invalid for tuples - will raise TypeError)
```

**Method Availability:**
Lists have methods that modify them in-place, like `append()`, `reverse()`, `extend()`, `pop()`. Tuples do not have these mutating methods.

```python
l = [1, 2, 3]
t = (10, 20, 30)

l.append(4)    # ✓
print(l)       # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
l.reverse()    # ✓
print(l)       # Output: [4, 3, 2, 1]
l.extend([5, 6]) # ✓ (Note: extend takes an iterable, [5,6] or (5,6))
print(l)       # Output: [4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 6]
item = l.pop(0)  # ✓
print(item)    # Output: 4
print(l)       # Output: [3, 2, 1, 5, 6]

# Tuple methods like append, reverse, extend, pop do not exist
# t.append(40)   # ✗ AttributeError
# t.reverse()    # ✗ AttributeError
# t.extend((50)) # ✗ AttributeError (also, (50) is not an iterable of multiple items, (50,) is)
# t.pop()        # ✗ AttributeError
```

**Concatenation with `+=`:**
For lists, `+=` usually modifies the list in-place (its `id` remains the same). For tuples, `+=` creates a new tuple (its `id` changes).

```python
l = [1, 2, 3]
id_l_before = id(l)
l += [6, 7]
id_l_after = id(l)
print(l)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 6, 7]
print(f"List ID before: {id_l_before}, ID after: {id_l_after}") # Often the same

t = (1, 2, 3)
id_t_before = id(t)
t += (8,)  # Note the comma to make (8,) a tuple
id_t_after = id(t)
print(t)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 8)
print(f"Tuple ID before: {id_t_before}, ID after: {id_t_after}") # Will be different
```

**Shared Sequence Properties:**
Both lists and tuples support common sequence operations:

```python
l = [10, "list_item", 30]
t = (40, 50, "tuple_item")

# Reading elements by index
print(l[1])  # ✓ Output: list_item
print(t[2])  # ✓ Output: tuple_item

# Modifying list element (already covered, but for context)
l[1] = "new_list_item"  # ✓
print(l)               # Output: [10, 'new_list_item', 30]

# Attempting to modify tuple element (already covered)
# t[2] = "new_tuple_item" # ✗ TypeError

# Checking for membership
print(10 in l)            # ✓ Output: True
print("tuple_item" in t)  # ✓ Output: True

# Both are sequence types and support iteration, len(), etc.
```

## Slices: Accessing Subsequences

Beyond accessing single elements, Python allows you to extract subsequences (parts of a sequence) using "slices".

The slice notation is `<sequence>[<start>:<stop>:<step>]`.

*   `<start>`: The index of the first element to include (default is 0).
*   `<stop>`: The index of the first element *not* to include.
*   `<step>`: The amount to increment the index by (default is 1). A negative step reverses the order.

The colons `:` are essential. `<start>`, `<stop>`, and `<step>` are optional numerical expressions.

### Slice Objects

Alternatively, you can create a `slice` object and use it to index sequences.

```python
my_list = list(range(20))  # A list from 0 to 19

# Using a slice object
s = slice(1, 10, 2)  # Start at 1, stop before 10, step by 2
print(my_list[s])      # Output: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]

# Equivalent direct slicing
print(my_list[1:10:2]) # Output: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
```

!!! question "Understanding Slice and List Nature"
    1. Is `slice` a function or a type (class)?  
    2. Consider a list variable, for example, `my_list = [1, 2, 3]`. Is `my_list` a function or an instance of a type?  

!!! question "Identifying Valid Slice Syntax"
    Determine if the following represent syntactically valid slice notations. Consider if they would work in an expression like `my_sequence[notation]`.  
    1. `1:2:1`  
    2. `2:4:7`  
    3. `9:1:-1`  
    4. `a:b:c` (Assume `a`, `b`, `c` are variables holding integers or `None`)  
    5. `1.5:2.3:3.14` (Note: Slice indices must be integers or `None`)  
    6. `a:2:3` (Assume `a` is a variable holding an integer or `None`)  
    7. `6:7`  
    8. `:-5:-1`  
    9. `::-1`  

## Other Sequence Types

While lists and tuples are very common, Python offers other specialized sequence types.

### Array

The `array` module provides an `array` object that is more memory-efficient for storing sequences of basic numeric types (e.g., integers, floating-point numbers).

*   **Homogeneous Types:** All elements in an array must be of the same C-style data type (e.g., all integers, all floats).
*   **Performance:** Can be faster than lists for numerical operations due to fixed types and direct memory offsets.
*   **Usage:** You need to `import array` before using it.

```python
import array

# 'i' specifies signed integer type
int_array = array.array('i', [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(int_array)
# int_array.append(6.0) # This would cause a TypeError
```

### Deque

The `collections` module offers `deque` (double-ended queue), which is optimized for fast appends and pops from both ends.

*   **Efficient Appends/Pops:** `appendleft()` and `popleft()` are O(1) operations, unlike lists where inserts/deletes at the beginning are O(N).
*   **Use Cases:** Useful for implementing queues, stacks, or keeping a running history of items (e.g., last N items seen).

You can find more information about `deque` in the official Python documentation:
[collections.deque](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque)

!!! info "Further Learning"
    Python provides a rich set of data structures. While we can't cover every function or method for every type in class, you've learned the fundamental "how-to" of exploring and using them. Always refer to the official Python documentation for detailed information on specific types and their capabilities.

## Review: Core Python Concepts

Let's recap some fundamental ideas:

*   **Python Variables as Names:** In Python, variables are essentially names or labels that refer to objects stored in memory.
*   **Object Components:** Every object in Python has three key characteristics:
    1.  **Identity (`id()`):** A unique identifier for the object (often its memory address).
    2.  **Type (`type()`):** The kind of object it is (e.g., `int`, `list`, `str`, `tuple`).
    3.  **Value:** The actual data stored in the object.
*   **Basic Data Types:** Python has several built-in basic types, including:
    *   Boolean (`bool`): `True` or `False`.
    *   Numeric types: `int`, `float`, `complex`.
    *   Sequences: `list`, `tuple`, `str`, `range`, `bytes`, `bytearray`.
    *   Mappings: `dict`.
    *   Sets: `set`, `frozenset`.

Streaming response: # Chapter 1: Python Basics and Control Flow

## Introduction

This chapter covers the elementary theory of Python, introducing fundamental building blocks, functions, and essential control flow mechanisms like `for` loops and `if` conditions. Understanding these concepts is key to constructing effective programs.

!!! quote "An Analogy: Programming as Construction"
    If we liken a program to a building, variables are the blocks, and syntax tells the programmer how to put these blocks together to form walls. Different programs are simply different ways to assemble these walls.

## Mapping: Dictionaries

### What are Dictionaries?

We’ve learned how to access elements from a list or a tuple by subscripting (e.g., `my_list[0]`). This method relies on the order of elements. However, sometimes it's more intuitive to access elements by a specific name or identifier. Dictionaries are Python's built-in mapping type that allows us to store and retrieve items using keys instead of numerical indices.

### Creating Dictionaries

There are several ways to create dictionaries in Python:

1.  **Using curly braces `{}` with key-value pairs:**
    ```python
    age = {"Alice": 21, "Bob": 32, "Charlie": 44}
    ```

2.  **Using the `dict()` constructor with keyword arguments:**
    ```python
    name = dict(stu1="Alice", stu2="Bob", stu3="Charlie")
    ```

3.  **Using the `dict()` constructor with a list of key-value tuples:**
    ```python
    grade = dict([['stu1', 87], ['stu2', 99], ['stu3', 65]])
    ```

4.  **Using `dict.fromkeys()` to create a dictionary with specified keys and a default value (or `None` if no value is provided):**
    ```python
    # Creates {'key1': None, 'key2': None}
    new_dict = dict.fromkeys(["key1", "key2"])
    
    # Creates {'key1': 0, 'key2': 0}
    another_dict = dict.fromkeys(["key1", "key2"], 0)
    ```

### Accessing Elements: Keys and Values

In a dictionary, the "names" used for lookup are called **keys**, and the associated data are called **values**. Each key-value pair is an item in the dictionary.

You can look up an element (a value) by providing its key within square brackets `[]`:
```python
age = {"Alice": 21, "Bob": 32}
print(age["Alice"])  # Output: 21
```

#### Using `get()` for Safe Access

If you try to access a key that is not in the dictionary using square brackets, Python will raise a `KeyError`, and your program will stop. To avoid this, you can use the `get()` method. If the key is not found, `get()` returns `None` by default (or a specified default value), allowing the program to continue.

```python
age = {"Alice": 21, "Bob": 32}
print(age.get("Alice"))    # Output: 21
print(age.get("David"))    # Output: None
print(age.get("David", "Not Found")) # Output: Not Found
```

!!! question "Exercise: Identifying Keys and Values"
    For the three dictionaries `age`, `name`, and `grade` defined in the "Creating Dictionaries" section:
    1. What are the keys in each dictionary?
    2. What are the corresponding values?  
    
### Subscripting and Potential Errors

When taking out elements by subscripting:

*   `age["Alice"]` correctly retrieves the value if "Alice" is a key.
*   Consider a list `l = [1, 2, 3]`. Accessing `l[3]` will result in an `IndexError` because the valid indices are 0, 1, and 2.
*   Accessing `age["David"]` (assuming "David" is not a key in the `age` dictionary) will result in a `KeyError`. This highlights the importance of error handling or using methods like `get()`.

## Flow Control Part I: The `for` Loop

### Iterating Over Sequences

How can we access all the elements in a container like a list, tuple, or dictionary one by one?

### Manual vs. Automated Iteration

We could take them out manually by index:
`l[0]`, `l[1]`, `l[2]`, etc.

Or, we could create an index variable to help us:
```python
l = [1, 2, 3]
i = 0
# print(l[i]) # Accesses l[0]
i = 1
# print(l[i]) # Accesses l[1]
# And so on...
```

!!! note "A Note on `print()`"
    In many code examples, `print()` statements might be omitted for brevity to focus on the logic. In practice, you would use `print()` or other functions to observe or process the `l[i]` values.

A more convenient and Pythonic way is to rely on the automated `for` loop.

### The `for` Loop Syntax

The basic syntax for a `for` loop is:
```python
# for element in container:
    # do something with element
```
This loop iterates over each `element` in the `container` (e.g., a list, tuple, string, or dictionary).

!!! question "Exercise: Iterating with `for` Loops"
    1. Create a list and use a `for` loop to print its elements.
    2. Create a tuple and use a `for` loop to print its elements.
    3. Create a dictionary and use a `for` loop to print its values. (Hint: Use `.values()`)
    4. Create a dictionary and use a `for` loop to print its keys. (Hint: Iterating directly over a dictionary yields keys, or use `.keys()`)
    5. For a dictionary, print its key-value pairs in a formatted way using an f-string. (Hint: Use `.items()`)  
    
### The `range()` Function

We informally introduce a useful function for `for` loops: `range()`. The `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers, which is often used for looping a specific number of times or for generating indices. `range` is very similar to slices.

Here are some examples:

*   `range(10)`: Generates numbers from 0 up to (but not including) 10. (0, 1, ..., 9)
    ```python
    # list(range(10)) would produce [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    ```
*   `range(1, 11)`: Generates numbers from 1 up to (but not including) 11. (1, 2, ..., 10)
    ```python
    # list(range(1, 11)) would produce [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    ```
*   `range(0, 30, 5)`: Generates numbers from 0 up to 30, with a step of 5. (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25)
    ```python
    # list(range(0, 30, 5)) would produce [0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
    ```
*   `range(0, 10, 3)`: Generates numbers from 0 up to 10, with a step of 3. (0, 3, 6, 9)
    ```python
    # list(range(0, 10, 3)) would produce [0, 3, 6, 9]
    ```
*   `range(0, -10, -1)`: Generates numbers from 0 down to -10, with a step of -1. (0, -1, ..., -9)
    ```python
    # list(range(0, -10, -1)) would produce [0, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8, -9]
    ```
*   `range(0)`: Generates an empty sequence.
    ```python
    # list(range(0)) would produce []
    ```
*   `range(1, 0)`: Generates an empty sequence (start is greater than stop, and step is positive by default).
    ```python
    # list(range(1, 0)) would produce []
    ```

## Flow Control Part I: The `if` Statement

### Conditional Execution

There are circumstances when we only want to execute a block of code if a certain condition is met. For example, given a list of numbers, we might only want to process:

*   Numbers that are squares of some integer.
*   Numbers that are cubics of some integer.
*   Just the odd numbers.

In other words, we execute code *only if* an element satisfies a particular condition. This is where the `if` statement, a fundamental control flow structure, comes into play.

### The `if` Statement Syntax

Here's an example demonstrating the `if` statement within a `for` loop:
```python
l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
for element in l:
    if element % 2 == 0:  # Condition: is the element even?
        print(f"{element} is an even number.")
```
In this code, the `print()` statement is executed only for elements that satisfy the condition `element % 2 == 0`.

!!! question "Exercise: Conditional Filtering"
    Using the list `l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]`:
    1. Print only the elements that are odd.
    2. Print only the elements that are perfect squares (e.g., 1, 4, 9).
    3. Print only the elements that are perfect cubics (e.g., 1, 8).  
    
### Comparison Operators: `==` vs. `is`

In `if` statements, conditions often involve comparisons.

#### Comparing Values
To compare the values of two objects (especially numbers), we use operators like:

*   `<` (less than)
*   `>` (greater than)
*   `==` (equal to)
*   `<=` (less than or equal to)
*   `>=` (greater than or equal to)
*   `!=` (not equal to)

#### Comparing Identity
To compare if two variables refer to the *exact same object* in memory, we use the `is` operator.

#### The `None` Object
`None` is a special singleton object in Python used to represent the absence of a value or a null value. It's important to understand how to test for `None`.

!!! info "Investigating `None`"
    `None` is unique. There's only one `None` object in a Python program. When checking if a variable is `None`, it's conventional and often more correct to use `is None` rather than `== None`.

### Boolean Expressions from Comparisons

Comparison expressions (e.g., `x > 5`, `name == "Alice"`) evaluate to Boolean values: `True` or `False`.

!!! note "What is an Expression?"
    By "expression," we refer to a piece of Python code that can be evaluated to produce a value. The formal definition is more involved and typically covered in detail in advanced programming courses.

Comparison expressions use operators like `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`, `is`, and `is not`.

#### Chained Comparisons
Python supports chained comparisons, making some expressions more concise and readable. For example:
```python
a, b, c, d, e = 1, 4, 3, 3, 5
result = a < b > c == d != e
# This is equivalent to: (a < b) and (b > c) and (c == d) and (d != e)
print(result) # Evaluates based on the values
```

!!! warning "Comparing with `None`"
    A special note concerns comparisons involving `None`. When checking if an object is `None`, you should use `is` or `is not`.
    
    For example: `if my_variable is None:`
    
    This is because, unlike other values which can have multiple instances (e.g., the integer `5` can appear many times), `None` is a unique singleton object. In Python, we use `is` to compare the `id` (identity) of objects, so when

# Python Data Structures and Pythonic Code

## `None`: The Null Object

In Python, `None` is a special singleton object representing the absence of a value or a null value. It can be thought of as having `Null` as its conceptual name, though in Python code it is always referred to as `None`.

We use the `is` operator to compare the identity (`id`) of objects. Since `None` is a singleton, all references to `None` point to the same object. Therefore, when we assign `None` to multiple variables:

```python
a = None
b = None
```
Checking `a is b` will return `True`.

## Data Structures

### Mapping: Dictionaries

Dictionaries are a fundamental mapping type in Python. They store data as key-value pairs and are highly optimized for retrieving values when the key is known.

#### Adding and Combining Dictionaries
To add a new key-value pair or update an existing one, you can use the `[]` operator:
```python
my_dict = {'name': 'Alice'}
my_dict['age'] = 30 # Adds 'age': 30
my_dict['name'] = 'Alice Smith' # Updates value for 'name'
```

To merge one dictionary into another, the `update()` method is commonly used:
```python
dict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
dict2 = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}
dict1.update(dict2) # dict1 becomes {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}
```

!!! info "Further Reading: `dict.update()`"
    For more details on how `update()` handles merging and potential overwrites, refer to the official Python documentation:
    [https://python-reference.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/dict/update.html](https://python-reference.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/dict/update.html)

Dictionaries are structurally very different from sequence types like lists or tuples.

#### Dictionaries vs. Lists: Modifying in Loops

Care must be taken when modifying collections (like dictionaries or lists) while iterating over them.

**Dictionary Modification Example:**
The following shows an attempt to remove items from a dictionary based on a condition.
```python
d = {'a': [1], 'b': [1, 2], 'c': [], 'd': []}

# To remove items from a dictionary where the value is an empty list:
keys_to_remove = []
for key in d: # Iterates over keys
    if not d[key]: # Checks if the list associated with key is empty
        keys_to_remove.append(key)

for key in keys_to_remove:
    d.pop(key)
# print(d) # Output would be {'a': [1], 'b': [1, 2]}
```

!!! warning "Modifying Collections During Iteration"
    Modifying a dictionary or list directly while iterating over it using a standard `for` loop can lead to unexpected behavior or errors (like `RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration` for dictionaries, or `IndexError` for lists when indices shift). It's generally safer to:
    1. Iterate over a copy of the collection's keys or items (e.g., `for key in list(d.keys()):`).
    2. Create a list of items to add/remove and perform modifications after the loop (as shown in the example above).
    3. Use comprehensions or build a new collection.

**List Modification Example (Illustrating Potential Issues):**
The following code snippet from the raw notes attempts to remove elements from a list using `pop` within a loop indexed by `range`.
```python
my_list_example = [1, 2, 3, 0, 5]
# The original code was:
# for i in range(4):
#     my_list_example.pop(i)
# This loop will result in an IndexError because as elements are popped,
# the list shrinks, and the original range of indices becomes invalid.
```
This example highlights a common pitfall. As elements are popped, the list's size changes, and the indices of subsequent elements shift. This often leads to `IndexError` or not removing the intended elements.

#### Loading JSON as Dictionaries
Python's built-in `json` module provides an easy way to work with JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data, often converting JSON objects into Python dictionaries and vice-versa.

```python
import json

# Example: Assume "settings.json" contains:
# {
#   "theme": "dark",
#   "font_size": 12,
#   "features": {
#     "spell_check": true,
#     "auto_save": false
#   }
# }

# To load this JSON file into a Python dictionary:
# with open("settings.json", "r") as f:
#     setting_dict = json.load(f)

# print(setting_dict)
# print(setting_dict.items())
```

!!! note "Working with JSON"
    The `json.load()` function is used to read a JSON formatted stream (like a file object) into a Python object (often a dictionary).
    The `json.loads()` (load string) function is used to parse a JSON string into a Python object.
    Conversely, `json.dump()` writes a Python object to a JSON formatted stream, and `json.dumps()` serializes a Python object to a JSON formatted string.

#### The `zip` Function
Before concluding our discussion on dictionaries, let's explore the `zip` function. The name `zip` is analogous to a zipper, which interleaves two sides. In Python, `zip` combines elements from multiple iterables (like lists or tuples) into an iterator of tuples.

For example, to combine account numbers with their balances:
```python
account = ["622848", "600314", "500297"]
balance = (1_000_000, 1_300_500, 500)

z1 = zip(account, balance)

for k, v in z1:
    print(k, "has a balance of", v)
```
The `zip` function returns an iterator. If the iterables are of different lengths, `zip` stops when the shortest iterable is exhausted.
This is very useful for creating dictionaries directly:
```python
# Example: Creating a dictionary from zipped lists
account_balances = dict(zip(account, balance))
# print(account_balances)
# Output: {'622848': 1000000, '600314': 1300500, '500297': 500}
```

### Object Types Review

!!! question "In-class Exercise: Identifying Python Types"  
    1.  What simple (primitive) data types have we learned so far?
    2.  What complex (collection/container) data types have we learned?
    3.  How do you typically distinguish them or determine an object's type in Python?  

### Strings
We have frequently used quotation marks in Python. Text enclosed in quotation marks (single `' '` or double `" "`) creates string objects, not variable names. Python generally treats single and double quotation marks interchangeably for defining strings.

A string is an immutable sequence of characters. It's formally known as a "string sequence type" and is a fundamental data type for handling text.

We will introduce three groups of useful string functionalities:

1.  **Case Conversion Methods**:
    *   `upper()`: Converts all characters to uppercase.
    *   `lower()`: Converts all characters to lowercase.
    *   `title()`: Converts the string to title case (first letter of each word capitalized).
2.  **Trimming Methods**:
    *   `strip()`: Removes leading and trailing whitespace (or specified characters).
    *   `lstrip()`: Removes leading whitespace (or specified characters).
    *   `rstrip()`: Removes trailing whitespace (or specified characters).
3.  **Regular Expression Functions (from the `re` module)**:
    *   `re.sub()`: Substitutes occurrences of a pattern in a string. (Requires `import re`)

!!! info "What is a Module?"
    A module in Python is a file containing Python definitions and statements. It allows you to logically organize your Python code. Modules can be imported and used in other Python scripts or interactive sessions. These can be built-in modules (like `json` or `re`), third-party libraries, or your own custom code.

!!! question "In-class Exercise: String Manipulations"  
    1.  **Reverse a string.** For example, given `s = "desserts"`, reverse it to get `"stressed"`. Reverse `"drawer"` to get `"reward"`. (These are known as anadromes.)
    2.  **Remove vowels from a string.** For example, `"drawer"` would become `"drwr"`.
    3.  **Count the number of words in a string.** (Hint: use the `split()` method).  

### Unordered Non-duplicate: Sets

#### Definition and Properties
By definition, a set object is an unordered collection of distinct hashable objects.

!!! info "Official Definition: Set Types"
    For more details, refer to the Python documentation:
    [https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset)

!!! note "What does 'hashable' mean?"
    An object is hashable if it has a hash value that never changes during its lifetime (it needs a `__hash__()` method) and can be compared to other objects (it needs an `__eq__()` method). Hashable objects that compare as equal must have the same hash value.
    Most immutable built-in objects are hashable (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples containing only hashable elements). Mutable containers (like lists or dictionaries) are not hashable.
    The Python glossary provides a good reference:
    [https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-hashable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-hashable)

Sets behave much like mathematical sets. The key characteristics are:
-   **Uniqueness:** Elements in a set are unique; duplicates are automatically removed.
-   **Unordered:** Elements in a set do not have a specific order (prior to Python 3.7, iteration order was arbitrary; since 3.7, it's insertion order for CPython, but "unordered" remains a core conceptual property for portability).

We can perform standard mathematical set operations:
-   `in` (membership test, ∈)
-   `issubset()` (⊂, or `<=` operator for sets)
-   `union()` (∪, or `|` operator)
-   `intersection()` (∩, or `&` operator)
-   `difference()` (−, or `-` operator)
-   `symmetric_difference()` (Δ, or `^` operator)

!!! question "In-class Exercise: Checking Hashability"  
    How do you check if an object is hashable in Python?
      For example, can you try to use a list as an element in a set? What happens and why?  

#### Creating Sets
There are several ways to create a set:

1.  **Using curly braces `{}`**:
    ```python
    my_set = {1, 2, 3, 'hello'}
    empty_set = set() # Note: {} creates an empty dictionary, not an empty set
    ```
2.  **Using the `set()` constructor**:
    This is useful for creating sets from other iterables like lists or strings.
    ```python
    another_set = set([1, 2, 2, 3, 'world']) # from a list
    # print(another_set) # Output might be {1, 2, 3, 'world'} (order may vary)
    char_set = set('hello')
    # print(char_set) # Output might be {'h', 'e', 'l', 'o'}
    ```
3.  **Using set comprehension** (similar to list comprehension, discussed later):
    ```python
    comp_set = {x * x for x in range(5)}
    # print(comp_set) # Output might be {0, 1, 4, 9, 16} (order may vary)
    ```

#### Modifying Sets and `frozenset`
Standard sets are mutable, meaning you can add or remove elements after creation (e.g., using `add()`, `remove()`, `discard()`, `pop()`, `update()`). See the exercise below for examples.

If you need an immutable version of a set (one that cannot be changed after creation, and thus can be used as a dictionary key or an element in another set), Python provides `frozenset`.
A `frozenset` is typically created using the `frozenset()` constructor:
```python
frozen = frozenset([1, 2, 3, 3]) # Duplicates are removed
# print(frozen) # frozenset({1, 2, 3})
# frozen.add(4) # This would raise an AttributeError: 'frozenset' object has no attribute 'add'
```

!!! question "In-class Exercise: Working with Sets"  
    1.  Create a set containing the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    2.  Add the number 6 to the set.
    3.  Create two sets: `set_a = {1, 2, 3, 4}` and `set_b = {3, 4, 5, 6}`.
    4.  Find the union of `set_a` and `set_b`.
    5.  Find the intersection of `set_a` and `set_b`.
    6.  Find the difference between `set_a` and `set_b` (elements in `set_a` but not in `set_b`).
    7.  Find the symmetric difference between `set_a` and `set_b` (elements in either set, but not in both).
    8.  Given the list `numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5]`, create a set to remove duplicate elements.
    9.  Convert the resulting set back into a list (which will now have fewer elements, and its order might not be preserved from the original list).  

## Pythonics

### Introduction to Pythonics
"Pythonic" is a somewhat loosely defined term. It generally refers to code that fits well with the idiomatic style of the Python language – code that is readable, efficient, and leverages Python's unique features effectively. Writing Pythonic code often means choosing the most "natural" or "Python-like" way to express a computation.

We have already encountered several Pythonic constructs and features:
-   `zip()`: For elegantly combining iterables.
-   `with` statement: For robust resource management (e.g., opening files).
-   `None`: As the idiomatic null object.
-   `sorted()`: For flexible sorting, often used with `key` functions.
-   f-strings (formatted string literals): For concise and readable string formatting.

There are many more Pythonic idioms. Let's explore a couple of prominent ones: comprehensions and `enumerate`.

### Comprehensions

Comprehensions provide a concise and often more readable way to create lists, sets, and dictionaries based on existing iterables. They can sometimes be more efficient than using explicit `for` loops with `append` calls or manual assignments.

#### Types of Comprehensions

1.  **List Comprehension**:
    Creates a new list by applying an expression to each item in an iterable.
    ```python
    # Creates a list of squares from 0 to 4
    # Usually faster than equivalent list.append() loops for simple cases.
    squares = [x * x for x in range(5)]
    # print(squares) # Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]
    ```

2.  **Set Comprehension**:
    Similar to list comprehension, but creates a set (automatically handling uniqueness).
    ```python
    # Creates a set of unique characters from a string
    unique_chars = {c for c in 'abcdcba'}
    # print(unique_chars) # Output (order may vary): {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'}
    ```

3.  **Dictionary Comprehension**:
    Creates a new dictionary from an iterable, specifying key-value pairs.
    ```python
    # Creates a dictionary mapping numbers to their squares
    num_to_square = {x: x ** 2 for x in range(5)}
    # print(num_to_square) # Output: {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16}
    ```

!!! note "What about Tuple Comprehension?"
    You might wonder if there's a "tuple comprehension." If you write syntax similar to a list comprehension but with parentheses:
    ```python
    gen_exp = (i for i in range(3))
    ```
    This does *not* create a tuple directly. Instead, it creates a **generator expression**. A generator expression is an iterator that produces values on demand (lazily). To get a tuple from a generator expression, you would pass it to the `tuple()` constructor:
    ```python
    my_tuple = tuple(i for i in range(3))
    # print(my_tuple) # Output: (0, 1, 2)
    # print(gen_exp)  # Output: <generator object <genexpr> at 0x...>
    ```

#### Comprehensions with Conditional Logic
Comprehensions can also include `if` clauses to filter elements during construction, and even `if-else` expressions to conditionally transform elements.

## Conditional Logic in List Comprehensions

List comprehensions are a concise way to create lists. Their power can be further extended by incorporating conditional logic, allowing for both filtering of elements and conditional assignment of values.

*   **Filtering Elements with `if`**:
    An `if` clause can be added at the end of the comprehension to include only those elements that satisfy a specific condition.

    *Example: Create a list of even numbers from 0 to 9.*
    ```python
    [x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
    ```

*   **Conditional Value Assignment with `if-else`**:
    An `if-else` expression can be used *before* the `for` clause to determine the value assigned to each new element based on a condition.

    *Example: Create a list where even numbers are kept as is, and odd numbers are incremented by 1.*
    ```python
    [x if x % 2 == 0 else x + 1 for x in range(10)]
    ```

!!! question "Exercise 1.3.1: Code Execution Time"
    How long does each of the following code snippets take to run? Consider how Python evaluates expressions within lists and tuples, especially when functions with side effects like `time.sleep()` are involved.
    (Assume `import time` has been executed).

    ```python
    # Snippet A
    [time.sleep(1), time.sleep(1), time.sleep(1)][0]
    ```

    ```python
    # Snippet B
    (time.sleep(1), time.sleep(1), time.sleep(1))[0]
    ```

## Understanding Python Objects and Their Values

Let's step back and revisit the fundamental characteristics of objects in Python. Every object is defined by three key components:

*   **Identity (`id`)**: A unique integer representing the object's memory location. This value is constant for the lifetime of the object.
*   **Type (`type`)**: Defines the nature of the object (e.g., integer, string, list) and the set of operations (methods and functions) that can be applied to it.
*   **Contents (Value)**: The actual data stored by the object.

Understanding these components is crucial for grasping how Python manages data and how variables interact with objects.

### Type Casting

!!! info "A Different Perspective: “你的打开方式不对?”"
    Sometimes, you might have data represented as one type, but you need to work with it as another. This situation can be whimsically described by the Chinese phrase “你的打开方式不对?” (Nǐ de dǎkāi fāngshì bù duì?), meaning "What if your way of opening/approaching it is wrong?" Type casting is the solution to "open" or interpret data with the correct type.

Type casting, or type conversion, is the process of changing an object from one data type to another. This is typically achieved by using the target type's constructor function (e.g., `int()`, `str()`, `list()`).

For example, `str(123)` converts the integer `123` to the string `"123"`.

It's important to remember that type casting generally creates a **new object** of the target type, rather than modifying the original object in place.

### Object Mutability

Consider what happens when we attempt to change an object's value after it has been created.

*   An object is **mutable** if its internal state or the value it holds can be changed after its creation, without altering its identity (`id`). Examples include lists, dictionaries, and sets.
*   An object is **immutable** if its value cannot be changed once it is created. New objects must be created to represent new values. Examples include integers, floats, strings, and tuples.

When the value of a mutable object is modified, its `id` (memory address) usually remains the same. Consequently, all variables referencing that object will reflect the change.

!!! note "The Nature of Mutable Objects"
    Mutable objects are very useful for operations that require in-place modifications, offering efficiency gains. However, they can also introduce complexities, particularly when multiple variables refer to the same mutable object, as changes through one reference affect all others. This behavior will be explored in more detail in later sections.

!!! question "Exercise 1.4.1: Identifying Mutable Types"
    What are some common mutable object types in Python? How can you programmatically verify if a given object or an object of a certain type is mutable?

## Further Resources

For a deeper dive into Python's object model, names, and values, the following resources are highly recommended:

*   **Python Names and Values** by Ned Batchelder: [https://nedbatchelder.com/text/names.html](https://nedbatchelder.com/text/names.html)
    *   An excellent explanation of how Python names (variables) relate to objects and values.
*   **CS 61A (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs)**: [https://cs61a.org/](https://cs61a.org/)
    *   Review materials from this course often provide a strong academic foundation for concepts like environments, objects, and mutability.

## Summary of Key Python Concepts

This discussion builds upon and relates to several foundational Python concepts:

*   **Additional Data Types**:
    *   `dict` (Dictionary): Mutable mappings of keys to values.
    *   `str` (String): Immutable sequences of characters.
    *   `set`: Mutable, unordered collections of unique elements.
*   **Control Flow**:
    *   `for`-loops: For iterating over sequences and other iterable objects.
    *   `if-elif-else` statements: For conditional execution of code blocks.
*   **Pythonic Styles**:
    *   Writing code that is clear, concise, and idiomatic to Python, often leveraging built-in features and a readable syntax.

Streaming response: # Chapter 2: Functions

This chapter delves into functions in Python, covering their fundamental role in programming, alongside more advanced topics such as decorators and generators. We will explore practical applications and include practice questions modeled after past exam problems to solidify your understanding and prepare you for assessments like Midterm 1.

Key topics you will learn:

*   Defining and using functions.
*   Understanding function arguments and return values.
*   Applying functions to solve common programming problems.
*   Advanced function concepts: decorators for modifying function behavior and generators for efficient iteration.
*   Numerical methods involving functions, such as the secant method.

## Midterm Preparation: Practice Questions

This section provides exercises based on past midterm questions to help you practice the concepts covered.

!!! question "Midterm 2024 Fall: Counting Runs in a Sequence"
    **Problem Description:**

    When a coin is tossed, it can result in one of two outcomes: "head" (represented by the number 1) or "tail" (represented by the number 0). If we toss a coin `n` times, we record the sequence of outcomes.

    For example, if `n=12`, a possible recorded sequence is `1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0`.

    A "run" is defined as a consecutive sequence of 1s. In the example sequence `1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0`, there are 4 runs:
    *   The first `1` (at index 0).
    *   The sequence `1 1 1` (starting at index 2).
    *   The `1` (at index 6).
    *   The sequence `1 1` (starting at index 8).

    **Task:**
    Create a Python function that takes a list of 0s and 1s (representing the coin toss outcomes) and returns the total number of runs of 1s in the sequence.

    You can use the following Python code to generate a random sequence for testing:
    ```python
    import random
    n = 10
    s1 = [random.randint(0, 1) for _ in range(n)]
    # print(f"Generated sequence: {s1}") # Optional: print to see the sequence
    # # Example call: count_runs(s1)
    ```

!!! question "Midterm 2024 Fall: Performance Timer Decorator"
    **Problem Description:**

    Code efficiency is a significant concern for programmers. To evaluate this, programmers often implement functions in different ways and measure the execution time of each version.

    **Task:**
    Develop a Python decorator named `timer_100`. This decorator should:
    1.  Execute the decorated function 100 times.
    2.  After all executions, print a single line stating the average execution time and the standard deviation of these 100 runs.

    **Sample Usage:**
    The decorator would be used as follows:
    ```python
    import random
    import time
    import statistics # For mean and stdev

    # Definition of your decorator 'timer_100' would go here

    @timer_100
    def sums():
        # Example function whose performance is to be measured
        numbers = [random.random() for _ in range(10)]
        s = sum(numbers) # Perform some computation

    # Call the decorated function
    sums()
    ```

    **Sample Output:**
    The output should be in a format similar to this (actual values will vary):
    ```
    The average run time is 0.000609s; the std is 0.076s.
    ```
    !!! note "Note on Sample Output Values"
        The specific values in the sample output are illustrative. The standard deviation appearing larger than the mean might indicate high variability or specific test conditions. Focus on implementing the calculation and formatting correctly.

## Numerical Methods

Functions are central to numerical methods, which are algorithms used to find approximate numerical solutions to mathematical problems, especially those that are difficult or impossible to solve analytically.

### Quasi-Newton's Method

Newton's method is a well-known iterative technique for finding the roots of a real-valued function. However, it comes with certain prerequisites:

*   **Proximity of Starting Point:** The initial guess must be sufficiently close to the actual root for the method to converge.
*   **Differentiability:** The function must be differentiable in the interval of interest, as Newton's method explicitly uses the function's derivative.

When these conditions are not met, particularly when a function is not differentiable or its derivative is complex to compute, alternative approaches like the secant method become valuable.

!!! question "Implementing the Secant Method for Root Finding"
    **Background: The Secant Method**

    The secant method is a numerical root-finding algorithm that approximates the root of a function *f* by iteratively finding the roots of secant lines. A secant line is a line that intersects two points on the curve of the function. This method can be viewed as a finite-difference approximation of Newton's method, as it does not require the explicit derivative of the function.

    The standard iterative formula for the secant method, using two initial approximations $x_0$ and $x_1$, is:
    $x_{i+1} = x_i - f(x_i) \frac{x_i - x_{i-1}}{f(x_i) - f(x_{i-1})}$

    !!! info "Formula from Lecture Notes"
        The raw lecture notes provided the following formula for the secant method:
        `𝑥𝑛+1=𝑥𝑛−𝑓(𝑥𝑛)𝑥𝑛−𝑥𝑛+1. 𝑓𝑥𝑛−𝑓(𝑥𝑛+1)`

        This can be transcribed as:
        $x_{n+1} = x_n - f(x_n) \frac{x_n - x_{n+1}}{f(x_n) - f(x_{n+1})}$

        This formulation is unconventional. If $x_{n+1}$ in the fraction refers to the value being calculated, the formula is implicit. It is more likely that the terms $x_{n+1}$ and $f(x_{n+1})$ in the fraction were intended to refer to a previous point, such as $x_{n-1}$ and $f(x_{n-1})$, aligning with the standard secant method formula. For this exercise, you should implement the **standard secant method** as described above.

    **Task:**
    1.  Implement the secant method as a Python function. Your function will require the function $f(x)$, two initial guesses ($x_0, x_1$), a tolerance for convergence, and a maximum number of iterations.
    2.  Use your implemented secant method to find a root of the equation $f(x) = \sqrt{x-3} - 1 = 0$.
        *   Choose appropriate initial guesses $x_0$ and $x_1$. Remember that for $\sqrt{x-3}$ to be real, $x \ge 3$.
        *   The analytical solution to this equation is $x=4$. Verify that your implementation converges to this solution.

## Advanced Function Concepts: Generators

Generators in Python provide a convenient way to create iterators. A generator is a function that returns an iterator object, which can be iterated over (like in a `for` loop) to produce a sequence of values one at a time. They are memory-efficient for working with large sequences of data because they generate values on demand, rather than storing the entire sequence in memory.

!!! question "Coordinating Generators Based on Time"
    **Task:**

    You are required to create two distinct generators and an orchestrating function that calls them based on the current time.

    1.  **Generator 1 (`odd

Streaming response: # Chapter 2: Functions

This chapter explores the fundamentals of functions in Python. You will learn:

*   How to define and call simple functions.
*   How functions are stored in memory as objects and the internal processes during a function call.
*   How functions create distinct memory spaces (namespaces) and how Python manages variable accessibility within these spaces.

!!! quote "Key Concept: Functions as First-Order Objects"
    In Python, functions are "first-order objects." This means they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned from functions, just like any other data type (e.g., integers, strings, lists).

## Simple Functions

Let's start by understanding the basics of creating and using functions.

!!! question "Exercise 2.1.1: File Processing for Training Camp"
    Context: You are managing a database for a training camp. Under the `data` folder, there are student information files from 5 classes. Each class has an `age.txt` and a `gender.txt` file.  
    
    1.  Please read in `age.txt` and `gender.txt` from class 1.
    2.  Create a new `.txt` file to store the combined information for class 1.
    3.  Repeat these steps for all other classes.  
    
From the exercise above, you might notice that processing each class involves repetitive tasks. Performing the same operations multiple times has several disadvantages:

*   **Prone to errors:** Copying and pasting code can lead to mistakes.
*   **Hard to modify:** If a change is needed, it must be applied in multiple places.
*   ... and other inefficiencies.

To address this, we learn to abstract repetitive procedures and encapsulate them into **functions**.

### Composition of a Function

A function is designed to perform a specific task, freeing us from repetitive work and improving efficiency. To achieve this, a function typically consists of the following components:

*   **Function Body:** This is the set of instructions that defines what the function does.
*   **Parameters:** Functions often need to operate on different data. Parameters are placeholders for the specific values (arguments) a function will work with when it's called.
*   **Name:** A descriptive name is crucial for identifying and calling the function.
*   **Return Value:** A function can (optionally) send a result back to the caller. We will discuss this in more detail later.

### Defining a Function in Python

Here's the standard Python syntax for defining a function:

```python
def <name>(<parameters>):
    <body>
    returnNone
```

!!! question "Exercise 2.1.2: Define a Function"
    Assemble the code you wrote for Exercise 2.1.1 to define a reusable function that can process the data for any given class.  
    
Once defined, a function is stored in memory, similar to other Python objects like lists or dictionaries. You can try printing the function object itself to see how Python represents it.

!!! info "Analogy to Mathematical Functions"
    Programming functions are conceptually similar to mathematical functions. In mathematics, if we need to repeatedly find the distance between any two points P1=(x₁, y₁) and P2=(x₂, y₂), we define a distance function, for example, `f(P1, P2) = sqrt((x₁ - x₂)² + (y₁ - y₂)²).`

We define functions so we can use (or **call**) them. In mathematics, given two specific points, say (1,2) and (3,4), we evaluate the function `f` by passing these specific values: `f((1,2), (3,4))`. Similarly, in Python, we call a function by its name, providing the necessary arguments.

!!! question "Exercise 2.1.3: Call a Function"
    Call the function you defined in Exercise 2.1.2 and apply it to process the data for class 2.  
    
!!! question "Exercise 2.1.4: Summarize Function Definition"
    Summarize the key steps involved in defining a function in Python.  
    
!!! question "Exercise 2.1.5: List Transformation"
    1.  Define a function that computes the square of each number in a given list. For example, if the input list is `l = [1, 2, 3]`, the function should produce `[1, 4, 9]`.
    2.  Store the new list (the list of squares) for future use.  
    
## Special Topic I: The Python Call Stack

When a function is called in Python, a mechanism known as the call stack manages its execution. Here's an example demonstrating how to inspect the call stack:

```python
import inspect

def print_stack():
    stack = inspect.stack()
    for frame in stack:
        print(f"Function : {frame.function}")
        print(f"Code context: {frame.code_context}") # Note: raw text was 'codecontext'
        print("-" * 80)

print_stack()
```

### Python Function Call Summary

The process of a Python function call can be summarized as follows:

1.  A new local frame is added to the call stack, forming a new environment for the function's execution.
2.  The function's formal parameters are bound to the arguments provided in the function call within this new frame.
3.  The body of the function is executed in this new environment.

!!! info "Source"
    Prof. John DeNero, CS61A, UCB

!!! question "Exercise: Function vs. Function Call"
    How do you distinguish between a function itself (the definition) and a function call (the execution)?  
    
## Special Topic II: Newton's Method

This topic delves into a more mathematical application of functions: finding roots.

Given a function `f(x)`, how can you find a value `x` such that `f(x) = 0`? Newton's method is a widely used iterative algorithm for this purpose.

!!! question "Exercise: Implementing Newton's Method"
    Write a Python function to find a root of the equation `f(x) = 3x² - sin(x) + x = 0`. Start your search around `x = -4.5`. The function should report the root when the approximation error is smaller than a predefined threshold.  
    
### Default Parameter Values

Consider the Newton's method exercise. We might want to set the error bound (threshold) each time we call the function. However, in many scenarios, we prefer to use a consistent default value, for instance, to ensure fairness in comparisons or for convenience.

Only in rare cases do we want to change the valueWe preallocate a value to the function, w

Streaming response: # Python Functions: Advanced Concepts and Scope

This document explores several advanced aspects of functions in Python, including default parameter behaviors, namespaces, variable scope, and the concept of functions as first-class objects.

## Default Parameter Values

In Python, we can assign default values to function parameters. This means if a function is called without providing a value for such a parameter, the default value is used automatically.

```python
def greet(name, message="Hello"):
    print(f"{message}, {name}!")

greet("Alice")  # Output: Hello, Alice!
greet("Bob", "Good morning")  # Output: Good morning, Bob!
```

While convenient, using mutable objects (like lists or dictionaries) as default values can lead to unexpected behavior, as the default value is evaluated only once when the function is defined.

### Mutable Default Arguments: A Common Pitfall

When a mutable object is used as a default argument, it is instantiated only once when the function is defined. Subsequent calls to the function without that argument will reuse the same object.

!!! question "Exercise: Mutable Default Argument Behavior"
    Try the code below. What do you find? Can you explain the behavior?
    ```python
    def append_to(element, to=[]):
        to.append(element)
        return to

    my_list = append_to(12)
    print(my_list)

    my_other_list = append_to(42)
    print(my_other_list)
    ```

!!! note "Best Practice for Mutable Defaults"
    To avoid unintended sharing of mutable default arguments, the common practice is to use `None` as a default and create a new mutable object inside the function if the argument is `None`.
    ```python
    def append_to_safer(element, to=None):
        if to is None:
            to = []
        to.append(element)
        return to
    ```

## Closures and Scope in Nested Functions

Python allows defining functions inside other functions. These inner functions can capture and remember the values of variables from their enclosing (outer) function's scope, even if the outer function has finished execution. This is known as a closure.

However, care must be taken when defining functions in a loop, especially if these functions refer to loop variables. This can lead to "late binding" issues where all created functions end up using the last value of the loop variable.

!!! question "Exercise: Function Factories and Late Binding"
    Consider the following code. What will `ff[3]()` output? Why? How could you modify it so each function `f` "remembers" the value of `i` at the time of its creation?
    ```python
    ff = {}
    for i in range(5):
        def f():
            return i
        ff[i] = f

    # What does this print?
    # print(ff[3]()) 
    ```
    **Hint:** Think about when `i` is evaluated by the inner function `f`.

## Namespaces and Variable Scope

Understanding namespaces and scope is crucial for writing correct and maintainable Python code.

A **namespace** is a system that holds a collection of names (identifiers) and maps them to objects. Think of it as a dictionary where keys are names and values are the objects they refer to. Python uses several namespaces, such as:

*   **Built-in Namespace**: Contains built-in functions and constants (e.g., `print()`, `len()`, `True`).
*   **Global Namespace**: Specific to a module. Contains names defined at the top level of a module or script.
*   **Local Namespace**: Specific to a function call. Contains names defined within that function (arguments, local variables).
*   **Enclosing Namespace**: For nested functions, this is the local namespace of any and all enclosing functions.

**Scope** refers to the region of a program where a particular namespace can be accessed directly (i.e., without needing to prefix it).

### Understanding Namespaces

Objects in Python primarily reside in heap memory, while the names that refer to these objects typically live in stack frames associated with function calls. Namespaces provide the mapping.

!!! question "Exercise: Swapping Variables and Inspecting Namespaces"
    1.  Write a Python function to swap the values of two variables `a` and `b`. For example, if `a=1` and `b=2` initially, after swapping, `a` should be `2` and `b` should be `1`.
    2.  Analyze your function. What namespaces are involved? How would you inspect the names within the `globals` and `builtins` namespaces?
        ```python
        # Example for inspection (run this in a Python interpreter or script)
        # import builtins
        # print(type(builtins), dir(builtins))
        # print(dir()) # Shows names in the current scope (often globals at top level)
        #
        # def my_swap_function(x, y):
        #     # Your swap logic here
        #     print("Inside function, locals:", locals())
        #     return x, y # Example, needs correct swap
        #
        # a_val = 10
        # b_val = 20
        # print("Before swap, globals contain 'a_val':", 'a_val' in globals())
        # a_val, b_val = my_swap_function(a_val, b_val)
        # print(f"After swap: a_val={a_val}, b_val={b_val}")
        ```

!!! question "Exercise: Inspecting the Local Namespace"
    How do you check the objects (names) currently defined within the local namespace of a function?

!!! info "Inspecting Namespaces"
    *   `globals()`: Returns a dictionary representing the current global namespace.
    *   `locals()`: Returns a dictionary representing the current local namespace.
    *   `dir()`: Without arguments, returns a list of names in the current local scope. With an object as an argument (e.g., `dir(builtins)`), it returns a list of valid attributes for that object.

### Scope of a Variable: The LEGB Rule

When Python encounters a variable name, it searches for it in a specific order of scopes. This is commonly known as the **LEGB rule**:

1.  **L**ocal: The current function's namespace.
2.  **E**nclosing function locals: Namespaces of any enclosing functions, from the innermost to outermost.
3.  **G**lobal: The namespace of the module containing the code.
4.  **B**uilt-in: The namespace containing Python's built-in functions and constants.

The interpreter stops at the first place the name is found. If the name isn't found in any of these scopes, a `NameError` is raised.

The `global` keyword can be used to indicate that a variable inside a function refers to a global variable. The `nonlocal` keyword (for nested functions) indicates that a variable refers to a variable in an enclosing (but not global) scope.

!!! question "Exercise: Variable Shadowing"
    What will the following code output? How can you ensure the built-in `max` function is used in the second `print` call, even after `max` has been reassigned?
    ```python
    print(max(1, 2))
    max = min  # Reassigning the name 'max'
    # print(max(1, 2)) # What happens here?
    ```

!!! question "Exercise: Purpose of Variable Scopes"
    Consider the following questions regarding variable scopes:
    1.  How does Python manage object lifetimes (e.g., through reference counting)? How does scope influence this?
        *   **Hint:** Think about avoiding unnecessary global variables.
    2.  Referring back to the "Function Factories and Late Binding" exercise (with `ff` and `f`), how could you explicitly ensure the inner function uses a variable from its enclosing scope that is *not* the loop variable `i` itself, but rather a copy of `i`'s value at each iteration?
        *   **Hint:** Consider default arguments to the inner function or using `nonlocal` with helper variables.
    3.  How do scopes help in "information hiding" or preventing unintended modification of variables from other parts of your code?
        *   **Hint:** The LEGB rule itself enforces a certain level of encapsulation.

## Functions as First-Class Objects

In Python, functions are "first-class objects." This means they can be:

*   Assigned to variables.
*   Stored in data structures (like lists or dictionaries).
*   Passed as arguments to other functions.
*   Returned as values from other functions.

Functions that operate on other functions (by taking them as arguments or returning them) are called **higher-order functions**.

### Functions as Return Values

A function can define an inner function and return it. The returned inner function often forms a closure, remembering its enclosing scope.

```python
def intercept_b(b):
    # b is 'captured' by slope_m_times_x
    def slope_m_times_x(x, m=2): # Example with slope m
        return m * x + b
    return slope_m_times_x

# Create a linear function with intercept 1
linear_func_b1 = intercept_b(1)
# Call the returned function
result = linear_func_b1(3) # Calculates 2*3 + 1
print(result) # Output: 7

linear_func_b5_m3 = intercept_b(5)
result2 = linear_func_b5_m3(3, m=3) # Calculates 3*3 + 5
print(result2) # Output: 14
```

### Functions as Arguments

You can pass functions as arguments to other functions. This is a powerful technique for customizing behavior.

```python
def call_counter(func_to_call, call_state={'count': 0}):
    call_state['count'] += 1
    print(f"Calling '{func_to_call.__name__}' for the {call_state['count']} time(s).")
    func_to_call()

def say_hello():
    print("Hello there!")

call_counter(say_hello)
call_counter(say_hello)
```

!!! question "Exercise: Enhancing Higher-Order Functions"
    1.  Modify the `intercept_b` (renamed from `intercept_1`) code example above so that the user can select the intercept `b` when creating the linear function. (This is already demonstrated in the example above).
    2.  Further modify the `intercept_b` example so that the user can also select the slope `m` when *creating* the `slope_m_times_x` function (i.e., `m` should also be a parameter to `intercept_b`).
    3.  Modify the `call_counter` example so that it does not use a mutable default argument for `call_state`. How can you achieve similar stateful behavior more safely or explicitly?

### Passing Arguments to Functions within Higher-Order Functions

In the `call_counter` example, the `func_to_call` was called without any arguments. What if the function we want to count calls for itself requires arguments?

Consider this initial approach:

```python
def simple_call_with_arg(func, arg_for_func, state={'calls':0}):
    state['calls'] += 1
    print(f"Call number {state['calls']}")
    func(arg_for_func)

# Example usage (note: print is a built-in function)
# simple_call_with_arg(print, "hello")
# simple_call_with_arg(print, "python")
# simple_call_with_arg(print, "world")
```
This works if `func` always takes exactly one argument. But what if it takes a variable number of arguments, or keyword arguments?

#### Arbitrary Positional Arguments: `*args`

When you are not sure how many positional arguments a function might receive (or need to pass on), you can use `*args`.
*   In a function definition, `*args` collects any extra positional arguments into a tuple named `args`.
*   In a function call, `*iterable` unpacks the elements of `iterable` as individual positional arguments.

The `*` operator is generally known as the packing (in function definition) or unpacking (in function call) operator for positional arguments.

!!! question "Exercise: Understanding Unpacking with `*`"
    How do the following assignments and print statements differ in their behavior and output?
    ```python
    a = 1, 2, 3       # What is 'a'?
    print(a)

    x, y, z = 1, 2, 3 # Multiple assignment
    print(x, y, z)

    # p, q = 1, 2, 3    # What happens here? ValueError

    r, *s, t = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 # Extended iterable unpacking
    print(r, s, t)      # What are r, s, and t?
    ```

!!! question "Exercise: Unpacking Patterns"
    Summarize the pattern of `*` in assignments by considering these cases. What are the types and values of the variables after each assignment?
    ```python
    # Case 1
    # *a, b = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
    # print(f"a: {a}, b: {b}")

    # Case 2
    # a, *b = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
    # print(f"a: {a}, b: {b}")

    # Case 3
    # *a, = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 # Note the comma after *a
    # print(f"a: {a}")

    # Case 4
    # a, *b, c = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
    # print(f"a: {a}, b: {b}, c: {c}")

    # Case 5: What happens if there aren't enough items for non-starred variables?
    # *a, b = 1 # Raises TypeError
    # print(f"a: {a}, b: {b}")
    ```

Note that when `*s` is used on the left side of an assignment, `s` becomes a list. When `*some_sequence` is used in a function call, it unpacks `some_sequence` into individual arguments.

Passing an indefinite number of arguments to a function often involves two steps:
1.  **Packing**: In the function definition, `*args` gathers multiple arguments into a tuple.
2.  **Unpacking**: If you then call another function with these gathered arguments, you might use `*args` again to unpack them.

Here's an updated `call_counter` using `*args`:
```python
def call_counter_with_args(func, *args_for_func, call_state={'count': 0}): # DANGER: mutable default
    call_state['count'] += 1
    print(f"Calling '{func.__name__}' (call #{call_state['count']}) with args: {args_for_func}")
    func(*args_for_func) # Unpacking args_for_func

# Example (using a safer way to handle call_state if this were production code)
# call_counter_with_args(print, "hello", "python", "world")
# call_counter_with_args(print, "Data:", 1, 2, 3, sep="-")
```
In the second call above, `print("Data:", 1, 2, 3, sep="-")` is effectively called.

#### Arbitrary Keyword Arguments: `**kwargs`

Similar to `*args` for positional arguments, `**kwargs` is used for keyword arguments.
*   In a function definition, `**kwargs` collects any keyword arguments that are not explicitly named parameters into a dictionary named `kwargs`.
*   In a function call, `**dictionary` unpacks the key-value pairs from `dictionary` as individual keyword arguments.

These named arguments must be passed to a function with the form `param_name=value`. Unlike `*args` which collects arguments into a tuple, `**kwargs` collects them into a dictionary.

Streaming response: # Advanced Function Arguments: `**kwargs` and Dictionary Unpacking

Continuing our discussion on function arguments, where `*args` collects positional arguments into a tuple, `**kwargs` plays a similar role for keyword arguments, collecting them into a dictionary.

## Keyword Arguments (`**kwargs`)

Keyword arguments are those passed to a function using the `parameter_name=value` syntax. When a function definition includes `**kwargs` as a parameter, it gathers any keyword arguments provided during the function call that do not correspond to other explicitly named parameters. These collected arguments are stored in a dictionary, where `kwargs` becomes the name of this dictionary.

!!! note "Key Concept: `**kwargs`"
    `**kwargs` (keywords arguments) allows a function to accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Inside the function, `kwargs` will be a dictionary where keys are the argument names (as strings) and values are the argument values.

## Unpacking Dictionaries with `**`

Just as the `*` operator unpacks iterables (like lists or tuples) into individual positional arguments, the `**` operator unpacks dictionaries. This is useful for passing the items of a dictionary as keyword arguments to a function, or for merging multiple dictionaries.

While there might be fewer common direct use cases for unpacking a dictionary into function arguments compared to unpacking a list, it is particularly useful for merging dictionaries:

```python
dict1 = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
dict2 = {"d": 4, "e": 5, "f": 6}
combined_dict = {**dict1, **dict2}
# combined_dict will be {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4, 'e': 5, 'f': 6}
```

!!! info "Applications of Dictionary Unpacking"
    Dictionary unpacking with `**` is highly effective for:
    *   Passing a pre-defined set of options from a dictionary to a function.
    *   Creating new dictionaries by merging or extending existing ones.
    *   Forwarding keyword arguments from one function to another, especially in decorators or wrapper functions.

## Order of Parameters and Arguments

The sequence in which different types of arguments are passed to a function and parameters are defined is strictly enforced in Python.

!!! quote "Important Rule: Argument Order"
    When calling a function, positional (unnamed) arguments must always precede keyword arguments.

This principle also extends to function definitions:

1.  Standard positional parameters.
2.  `*args` (for arbitrary positional arguments).
3.  Keyword-only parameters (parameters that must be specified by name, typically appearing after `*args` or a bare `*`).
4.  `**kwargs` (for arbitrary keyword arguments).

Additionally, within the parameter list of a function definition:

*   Parameters with default values must always follow parameters that do not have default values.

## In-Class Exercise: Summing Named Arguments

!!! question "Exercise: Sum of `**kwargs` Values"
    Remember that `**kwargs` in a function signature results in `kwargs` being a dictionary within the function. This dictionary holds all keyword arguments passed to the function that weren't explicitly defined in the function's parameter list. Like any dictionary, `kwargs` consists of key-value pairs.

    For more background on dictionary types in Python, you can consult the [official Python documentation on dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict).

    **Task:**
    Write a Python function named `sum_of_kwargs` that accepts an arbitrary number of named arguments. Assume the values associated with these named arguments will be numbers. The function should calculate and return the sum of these numeric values.

    For example:
    ```python
    def sum_of_kwargs(???):  # Define the correct parameter(s) here
        # Your implementation to sum the values from kwargs
        pass

    # Example usage (should work after you implement the function):
    # total = sum_of_kwargs(Alice=5, Bob=3, Charlie=4)
    # print(total)  # Expected output: 12
    #
    # total_2 = sum_of_kwargs(apple=10, banana=20, orange=30, grape=5)
    # print(total_2) # Expected output: 65
    ```
    Think about how you would iterate through the values of the `kwargs` dictionary to achieve this.

Prompt: Chapter 2 Functions. What you will learn. Functions in functional programming. “Functions are first ...
Streaming response: # Functions

This chapter delves into the nature and utility of functions, particularly within the paradigm of functional programming. You will learn about:

*   Functions as fundamental building blocks in functional programming.
*   The concept of functions as "first-class objects."
*   How functions, being objects, can interact with other functions.
*   The ability for functions to be stored in variables and assigned names – a key feature underpinning functional programming and modern language design.

We will explore these concepts through specific use cases.

!!! quote "Key Concept: Functions as First-Class Objects"
    In programming language design, a "first-class citizen" (or first-class object) is an entity that supports all the operations generally available to other entities. These operations typically include being passed as an argument, returned from a function, and assigned to a variable. When functions are first-class objects, it unlocks powerful programming techniques.

## Use Case I: Decorator

Before we dive into decorators, let's refresh some foundational concepts with an exercise.

!!! question "Exercise: Basic Statistical Functions"
    Given the tuple `t1 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)`:
    1.  Write a function to compute the average of `t1`.
    2.  Write a function to compute the standard deviation of `t1`.
    3.  Write a function to compute the skewness of `t1`.
    
    ```python
    t1 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    # Your function definitions and calls here
    ```

### Validating Function Arguments with `assert`

If you encountered an error when trying to pass data containing invalid values (e.g., `None`) to a function, you'd realize the importance of input validation. The correct approach is to ensure that arguments passed to your functions do not contain invalid values that could break their logic.

Here, we introduce the `assert` statement. An `assert` is a claim: we assert that a certain expression (what is an expression?) evaluates to `True`.

*   If the value of the expression is `True`, nothing happens, and the program proceeds.
*   If the value of the expression is `False`, the assertion fails, and an `AssertionError` occurs, typically halting the program.

!!! question "Exercise: Handling Invalid Inputs"
    Consider the tuple `t2 = (1, 2, 3, None, 5)`.
    1.  Apply the `average` function you wrote in the previous exercise to `t2`. Observe what happens.
    
    ```python
    t2 = (1, 2, 3, None, 5)
    # Attempt to use your average function with t2
    ```

Let's look at some examples of `assert` statements:

```python
# Example 1: This assertion will fail and raise an AssertionError
# The message "All values look good!" will be part of the error.
# assert None in [1, 2, 3], "All values look good!"

# Example 2: This assertion will pass because None is not in [1, 2, 3].
# No message will be printed because the assertion is true.
assert None not in [1, 2, 3] # "Contains None!" would be printed if this failed

# Example 3: A more typical use case for an error message
# This will fail and print the helpful error message.
# data = [1, 2, None, 4]
# for x in data:
#    assert x is not None, "Encountered a None value in the data!"
```

!!! note "Using `assert`"
    The `assert` statement is primarily a debugging aid. It helps catch internal errors or invalid conditions that should ideally not occur if the program logic is correct. While it can be used for input validation, dedicated error handling (e.g., `try-except` blocks or explicit checks with `if` statements raising custom errors) is often preferred for user-supplied input or external data.

!!! question "Exercise: Improving Functions with `assert`"
    1.  Modify the statistical functions you wrote earlier (average, standard deviation, skewness) to use `assert` statements to check for `None` values in the input data. Ensure your functions raise an `AssertionError` if `None` is found.

### Introduction to Decorators

Although `assert` is handy for adding checks, if you have many functions, modifying each one individually can be tedious. Moreover, if functions are provided by a third-party library, you might not be able to (or want to) modify their source code directly.

So, when we want to extend or modify the functionality of an existing function without altering its core code, we can use a **higher-order function**. A higher-order function is a function that either takes one or more functions as arguments, returns a function as its result, or both.

A **decorator** is a common application of higher-order functions. It's a way to wrap additional functionality around an existing function. The decorator takes the original function as an argument, defines a new "wrapper" function that adds the new behavior before and/or after calling the original function, and then returns this wrapper function.

#### Decorator Syntax Template

Here's the general syntax for defining and using a decorator:

```python
# To define a decorator as a higher-order function
def decorator_function(original_function):
    def wrapper_function(*args, **kwargs):
        # Code to execute before calling the original function
        print(f"Wrapper executed before {original_function.__name__}")
        
        result = original_function(*args, **kwargs) # Call the original function
        
        # Code to execute after calling the original function
        print(f"Wrapper executed after {original_function.__name__}")
        return result
    return wrapper_function

# To decorate a function using the @ syntax
@decorator_function
def my_function():
    print("my_function is executing")

# Calling the decorated function
my_function()

# This is equivalent to:
# def my_function():
#     print("my_function is executing")
# my_function = decorator_function(my_function)
# my_function()
```

!!! question "Exercise: Writing Decorators"
    Write decorators to perform the following tasks:

    1.  **Logging Function Calls:** Create a decorator that prints a line like "`<function_name>` function is being called." before the decorated function executes and a line like "`finish calling <function_name>` function." after it completes.
        
        *Example Usage and Expected Output:*
        ```python
        @log_calls  # Assuming your decorator is named log_calls
        def greet(name):
            print(f"Hello, {name}!")
            return f"Greetings to {name}"

        greet("Alice") 
        ```
        *Expected Output:*
        ```
        greet function is being called.
        Hello, Alice!
        finish calling greet function.
        ```

    2.  **Memoization (Caching Results):** Create a decorator that records the return values of previous calls to a function. If the decorated function is called again with the same arguments, the decorator should return the stored result immediately without re-executing the function. This is useful for computationally expensive functions.
        
        *Hint: You'll need a way to store argument-result pairs, like a dictionary.*

## Use Case II: Recursion

Another powerful concept, often related to functions calling other functions (or themselves), is **recursion**. If any function in Python can be passed to another function as a parameter, what happens if a function calls itself? This is the essence of recursion.

We'll explore recursion by:

*   Revisiting Newton’s method for finding roots.
*   Revisiting a function for calculating sums.
*   Introducing recursive approaches for:
    *   Finding the square root of a number.
    *   Generating the Fibonacci sequence.
    *   Calculating the factorial function.

### Newton's Method (Recursion)

Suppose we want to find the root of $f(x) = x^2 - 5$. We can start with an initial guess, say $x_0 = 0.5$.
Newton's method provides an iterative formula to find successively better approximations of the root:
$f'(x) = 2x$
$x_{next} = x_{current} - \frac{f(x_{current})}{f'(x_{current})} = x_{current} - \frac{x_{current}^2 - 5}{2x_{current}}$

Here's an iterative implementation:

```python
def newton_iterative_step(x_current):
    # For f(x) = x^2 - 5
    return x_current - (x_current**2 - 5) / (2 * x_current)

x = 0.5  # Initial guess
print(f"Initial guess: {x}")
for i in range(10):  # Perform 10 iterations
    x_prev = x
    x = newton_iterative_step(x)
    print(f"Iteration {i+1}: {x}")
    if abs(x - x_prev) < 1e-7: # Stop if convergence is met
        print("Converged.")
        break
```

#### Transition to Recursion

Pay attention to the iterative update: `x = newton_iterative_step(x)`. This repetitive application suggests a recursive structure. An iterative loop performing `x = f(x)` ten times is like `f(f(f(...f(initial_x)...)))`.

We can try to define a recursive version of Newton's method. Here is a starting point. Try to modify the code by yourself to make it work. You'll need a base case (stopping condition) and a recursive step.

```python
def newton_recursive_step(x_current):
    # For f(x) = x^2 - 5
    return x_current - (x_current**2 - 5) / (2 * x_current)

def find_root_newton_recursive(x, tolerance=1e-7, max_iterations=10, current_iteration=0):
    print(f"Iteration {current_iteration}: x = {x}")
    if current_iteration >= max_iterations:
        print("Max iterations reached.")
        return x
    
    x_next = newton_recursive_step(x)
    
    if abs(x_next - x) < tolerance:
        print("Converged.")
        return x_next
    else:
        # Recursive call:
        return find_root_newton_recursive(x_next, tolerance, max_iterations, current_iteration + 1)

# Example usage:
initial_guess = 0.5
root = find_root_newton_recursive(initial_guess)
print(f"Approximate root found: {root}")
print(f"Square of root: {root**2}") # Should be close to 5
```

!!! note "Key Concepts in Recursion"
    *   **Boundary Condition (Base Case):** This is crucial. It defines the condition under which the recursion stops. Without a base case, a recursive function would call itself indefinitely, leading to a stack overflow error. In Newton's method, this could be reaching a desired tolerance or a maximum number of iterations.
    *   **Recursive Step:** This is the part of the function where it calls itself, typically with modified arguments that move it closer to the base case.
    *   **Recursion vs. Loops:**
        *   Recursion often provides more elegant and intuitive solutions for problems that are inherently recursive (e.g., tree traversals, quicksort, merge sort).
        *   Iterative solutions (using loops) can sometimes be more efficient in terms of memory usage (avoiding the overhead of multiple function calls on the stack) and may be easier to reason about for simpler, linear problems.
        *   Any problem solvable with recursion can also be solved with iteration, and vice versa, though one approach might be more natural or practical.

### Summation (Recursion)

Based on what we learned from the Newton's method example, consider how the `sum_recursion` function below works. It calculates the sum of elements in a list.

```python
def sum_recursion(data_list):
    # Base case: if the list is empty, its sum is 0
    if len(data_list) == 0:
        return 0
    # Recursive step: sum of the first element and the sum of the rest of the list
    else:
        return data_list[0] + sum_recursion(data_list[1:])

# Example usage:
my_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
total = sum_recursion(my_numbers)
print(f"The sum of {my_numbers} is {total}") # Output: The sum of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is 15
```
The function works by:
1.  **Base Case:** If the input list `x` is empty (`len(x) == 0`), it returns `0`.
2.  **Recursive Step:** Otherwise, it returns the sum of the first element `x[0]` and the result of calling `sum_recursion` on the rest of the list `x[1:]`. This progressively shortens the list until the base case is met.

### Finding Square Root (Alternative Recursive Method)

While Newton's method is one way to find a square root, another recursive approach exists.
Mathematically, if we are looking for the square root $r$ of a number $x$, then $r$ must satisfy:
$r = \frac{x}{r}$

If this relation is satisfied, we can manipulate it to find an iterative improvement formula. Suppose we have an estimate $g$ for the square root of $x$. If $g$ is not the true root, then $g$ and $\frac{x}{g}$ will be on opposite sides of the true root (one larger, one smaller, unless $g$ is the root). A better estimate for the root would be their average:
A common derivation starts from $r^2 = x$.
If $g$ is an approximation of $r$, we can try to find a better approximation.
Consider the iterative formula often used, derived from an averaging idea:
If $g$ is our current guess for $\sqrt{x}$, then a possibly better guess is the average of $g$ and $\frac{x}{g}$.
$g_{next} = 0.5 \times (g_{current} + \frac{x}{g_{current}})$

This gives us a recursive relation to refine our guess for the square root:
$r_{new} = 0.5 \times (r_{old} + \frac{x}{r_{old}})$

We can implement this recursively:

```python
def sqrt_recursive(x, guess, tolerance=1e-7, max_iterations=100, current_iteration=0):
    if current_iteration >= max_iterations:
        print("Max iterations reached for sqrt_recursive.")
        return guess
    
    if x < 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot compute square root of a negative number.")
    if x == 0:
        return 0
        
    new_guess = 0.5 * (guess + x / guess)
    
    print(f"Sqrt Iteration {current_iteration}: guess = {new_guess}")

    if abs(new_guess - guess) < tolerance:
        print("Converged for sqrt_recursive.")
        return new_guess
    else:
        return sqrt_recursive(x, new_guess, tolerance, max_iterations, current_iteration + 1)

# Example usage:
number_to_sqrt = 25
initial_guess_sqrt = 1.0 # An initial guess
approx_sqrt = sqrt_recursive(number_to_sqrt, initial_guess_sqrt)
print(f"The square root of {number_to_sqrt} is approximately {approx_sqrt}")
print(f"Verification: {approx_sqrt}^2 = {approx_sqrt**2}")
```

The formula for iteratively approximating a square root, such as by Heron's method, can be expressed as a recursive relation. Consider the relationship:
`2r = r + x/r`
This can be rearranged to find the next approximation for `r`:
`r = 0.5 * (r + x/r)`

This is a recursive relation. If we add superscripts to denote the iteration step, it becomes clearer:
`r_next = 0.5 * (r_current + x / r_current)`

!!! question "Exercise 5.1: Square Root Recursion"
    1. Write a `root_recursion` function to find the square root of a number.
    Hint: Start from finding the square root of 7 and then generalize your function.  

!!! note "Recursive Relations"
    A recursive relation is fundamental in guiding the implementation of a recursion function. You should be very familiar with this concept.

### Fibonacci Sequence

!!! question "Exercise 6.1: Fibonacci Sequence"
    1. 请推导斐波那契数列的通项公式. 它的递推公式为：
       `a_{n+2} = a_{n+1} + a_n`
    2. Please implement a Python function to compute the values of the Fibonacci sequence.
       Hint: you can choose from two common approaches (iterative or recursive).  

### Factorial Calculation
As a final exercise on recursion, let's work on a common, simpler example.

!!! question "Exercise 7.1: Factorial Function"
    1. Please write a function to compute the factorial of a given number.  

## Map, Filter, and Reduce

Let’s start with the familiar `max` function. You already know its basic output:

```python
max(1, 2, 3, 4)
```
Output: `4`

If you try `max` with strings, Python can also determine the "maximum" based on lexicographical order:
```python
max("hello", "world", "Python")
```
Output: `'world'` (Note: In Python 3, "Python" < "hello" < "world" due to ASCII values. The example might intend a different outcome or just show it works with strings).

It also works with iterables like tuples:
```python
max((1, 2, 3))
```
Output: `3`

### Customizing `max` with a Helper Function

If we’re not satisfied with the default behavior (e.g., for strings, we might want the longest string), we can change it by defining a helper function. This function:

*   Takes an element (from the items being compared) as a parameter.
*   Returns the value (the standard) on which we want to sort or find the maximum.

For example, to find the longest string:
```python
def helper(s):
    return len(s)

max("hello", "world", "Python", key=helper)
```
Output: `'Python'`

### Anonymous Functions (`lambda`)

It can be cumbersome to define a named helper function every time we need custom comparison logic. We can use anonymous functions, also known as `lambda` functions, to define these helpers inline.

The syntax is `lambda arguments: expression`.

```python
max("hello", "world", "Python", key=lambda s: len(s))
```
Output: `'Python'`

### `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`

Now let’s turn to three useful higher-order functions often associated with functional programming paradigms.

#### The `map` Function
The `map` function applies a given function to every element of an iterable (like a list or tuple) and returns a map object (an iterator).

```python
list(map(len, ("hello", "world", "Python"))) # Convert map object to list for display
```
Output: `[5, 5, 6]`

#### The `filter` Function
The `filter` function constructs an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a function returns true. Similar to the `key` argument in `max`, we need to provide a function that sets the standard for filtering. This helper function must return a Boolean value (`True` or `False`).

```python
def long_string(s):
    return len(s) > 5

list(filter(long_string, ("hello", "world", "Python", "course"))) # Convert filter object to list
```
Output: `['Python', 'course']`

!!! question "Exercise 8.1: Filter with Anonymous Function"
    1. Replace the named helper function (`long_string`) in the `filter` example above with an equivalent anonymous function (`lambda`).  

#### The `reduce` Function
The last technique is the `reduce` function. Unlike `map` and `filter` (which are built-in), `reduce` needs to be imported from the `functools` module in Python 3.

The `reduce` function applies a binary function (a function that takes two arguments) cumulatively to the items of an iterable, from left to right, so as to reduce the iterable to a single value.

The helper function for `reduce` must:

*   Take two parameters.
*   Return a value of the same type as the accumulated value (often, but not strictly, the same type as the items).

```python
from functools import reduce

reduce(lambda x, y: x + " " + y, ("hello", "world", "Python"))
```
Output: `'hello world Python'`

## Generators

We have learned about iterators. (What is an iterator? An object that implements the iterator protocol, `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods). Generators provide a special and convenient way to create iterators.

We can create our own generators in two main ways:
1.  Through generator expressions.
2.  Through a generator function.

!!! question "Exercise 9.1: Functions Outputting Generators"
    1. List examples of built-in functions or operations in Python that output generators (or iterators that behave like generators).  

### Generator Expressions

We learned the idea of list comprehensions in Chapter 1. If you use parentheses `()` instead of square brackets `[]` in a comprehension-like syntax, you are not creating a "tuple comprehension." Instead, you are creating a generator expression.

```python
type((x for x in range(5)))
```
Output: `<class 'generator'>`

!!! question "Exercise 10.1: Squares Generator"
    1. Create a generator expression to help compute squares of numbers (e.g., 1, 4, 9, 16, ...).
    2. What is necessary for you to define a generator like this? (Think about the components of a generator expression).  

### Generator Functions

Generator functions are defined like regular functions, but they use the `yield` keyword. Wherever a `yield` statement appears in a function, that function becomes a generator function.

The term `yield` means to give up or surrender something. For example, yield signs on the road tell drivers to give up the right-of-way to other traffic.

In a computer program, when a generator function encounters a `yield` statement, it does something similar:

*   It "yields" a value (this value is sent to the caller).
*   Its state is saved, and its execution is suspended.
*   Other parts of the program can then use the computing resources.

When the generator function is called upon again (e.g., by iterating to the next value), it resumes execution from where it left off, with its state intact, until it encounters another `yield` statement or the function terminates.

# NumPy and Pandas for AI Programming

## Overview

This chapter delves deeper into data manipulation using NumPy and Pandas, focusing on:

*   Processing and transforming single tables.
*   Converting tables between long and wide formats.
*   Dividing tables into manageable groups for analysis.
*   Reinforcing concepts with practical examples.

## Reshaping DataFrames: `pivot_table` and `melt`

Sometimes, the way data is structured in a table isn't ideal for analysis. We might need to reshape it.

!!! info "Distinction from `stack` and `unstack`"
    Methods like `stack()` and `unstack()` can change the presentation of data by moving information between the index and columns. However, the actual data values remain unchanged. For instance, a 6x2 table might become a 3x4 table, but the numbers themselves are merely rearranged.

We will now explore methods that go further by interchanging index/column information with the table's content.

!!! note "Key Concept: Long vs. Wide Tables"
    *   A table is considered **long** when it has more rows than desired for a particular analysis, often with repeated information across rows or multiple observations stacked vertically.
    *   A table is considered **wide** when it has more columns than desired, potentially making it difficult to compare certain variables or when observations are spread horizontally across columns.

    We use `pivot_table` to transform long tables into wider ones and `melt` to convert wide tables into longer ones.

### Pivoting Tables: From Long to Wide with `pivot_table`

Let's start by creating a "long" DataFrame to demonstrate pivoting. This DataFrame is considered "long" because each unique combination of `date` and `grades` for a `score` is on its own row.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

data = {
    "score": [90, 91, 92, 80, 81, 82, 60, 61, 62, 50, 51, 52],
    "grades": ["A"]*3 + ["B"]*3 + ["C"]*3 + ["D"]*3,
    "date": pd.to_datetime(["2020-01-03", "2020-01-04", "2020-01-05"] * 4)
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print("Original Long DataFrame:")
print(df)
```

We use `pivot_table` to convert such a long table to a wider format. For instance, we might want `date` as the index, `grades` as columns, and `score` as the values. The table we want would look like this:

```
grades        A   B   C   D
date
2020-01-03   90  80  60  50
2020-01-04   91  81  61  51
2020-01-05   92  82  62  52
```

Here's how to achieve this using `pivot_table`:

```python
pivoted = df.pivot_table(
    index="date",      # Values from this column become the new index
    columns="grades",  # Values from this column become the new column headers
    values="score"     # Values from this column fill the table
)
print("\nPivoted Wide DataFrame:")
print(pivoted)
```

!!! question "Exercise: Pivot a Custom Table"
    First, create a DataFrame from the following data:
    ```python
    exercise_data = {
        "value": range(13),
        "variable": ["A"]*4 + ["B"]*3 + ["C"]*3 + ["D"]*3,
        "date": pd.to_datetime(
            ["2020-01-03"]*5 +
            ["2020-01-04"]*4 +
            ["2020-01-05"]*4
        )
    }
    exercise_df = pd.DataFrame(exercise_data)
    print("Original Exercise DataFrame:")
    print(exercise_df)
    ```
    Instructions: Pivot this table using `date` as the index, `variable` as columns, and aggregate `value` using `sum`.

    The `pivot_table` method is more powerful than simply changing the locations of data. Its `aggfunc` parameter can summarize information for each cell in the new pivoted table if there are multiple values that map to it. For example, to sum values:

    ```python
    # Solution for the exercise:
    # pivoted_exercise = exercise_df.pivot_table(
    #    index="date",
    #    columns="variable",
    #    values="value",
    #    aggfunc="sum"  # Aggregate function
    # )
    # print("\nPivoted Exercise DataFrame (sum):")
    # print(pivoted_exercise)
    ```

!!! question "Exercise: Analyzing Mall Sales Data with `pivot_table`"
    First, read in the `MallSales.csv` data. (You'll need to ensure this file is accessible in your environment).
    ```python
    # Example:
    # mall_sales_df = pd.read_csv("MallSales.csv")
    # print(mall_sales_df.head())
    ```
    Then, perform the following operations:

    1.  Pivot the table to compute the sum of `Sales` by `Year` and `Category`. What issues do you encounter? (Hint: Consider data types or missing values if errors occur).
    2.  Pivot the table to compute the average `Sales` by `Year`.
    3.  Pivot the table to see the average `Rating` by `Product`.
        !!! tip "String Operations"
            To convert a column to string type, you can use `.astype(str)`. To access string methods for a Series, use `.str`. For example, `df['column'].str.rstrip('%')` removes a trailing '%' character from each string in the 'column'.
    4.  Pivot the table to show both the sum and mean of `Sales` by `Year` and `Category`. (Hint: `aggfunc` can take a list of functions, e.g., `aggfunc=['sum', 'mean']`).
    5.  Nest `Product` under `Category` in the index and redo question 4. (Hint: `index` can take a list of columns, e.g., `index=['Category', 'Product']`).  

### Melting Tables: From Wide to Long with `melt`

Conversely, we use `melt` to convert a wide table into a longer one. A DataFrame is considered "wide" or "messy" when it has too many columns, especially if those columns represent variables that could be better organized into fewer columns with more rows. This makes it harder to find or analyze useful information.

For example, consider data where multiple attributes of an entity are spread across columns:
```python
# Assume messydata1.csv contains data like:
# Name,ID,Age,Gender
# Alice,101,30,F
# Bob,102,25,M
# This is wide if ID, Age, Gender are seen as different 'measurements' of Name.

data_attributes_as_columns = {
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob'],
    'ID': [101, 102],
    'Age': [30, 25],
    'Gender': ['F', 'M']
}
messydata1_df = pd.DataFrame(data_attributes_as_columns)
print("Original DataFrame (attributes as columns):")
print(messydata1_df)
```

We can "melt" this DataFrame to a long format, where one column stores the attribute type (e.g., 'ID', 'Age', 'Gender') and another stores its value. `id_vars` specifies columns that should remain as identifiers.

```python
long_format_df = messydata1_df.melt(
    id_vars=["Name"],         # Column(s) to keep as identifier variables
    var_name="Attribute",     # Name for the new column holding former column names
    value_name="Value"        # Name for the new column holding values
)
print("\nMelted DataFrame (long format):")
print(long_format_df)
```

Then we can make smaller and neater DataFrames by filtering this long format:
```python
ids = long_format_df.loc[lambda df: df['Attribute'] == 'ID', :]
ages = long_format_df.loc[lambda df: df['Attribute'] == 'Age', :]
genders = long_format_df.loc[lambda df: df['Attribute'] == 'Gender', :]

print("\nFiltered IDs:")
print(ids)
print("\nFiltered Ages:")
print(ages)
print("\nFiltered Genders:")
print(genders)
```

**Another example: French Fries Data**

Consider a dataset on French fries tasting scores, where each sensory attribute (e.g., `potato`, `buttery`, `grassy`) is a separate column. This is a "wide" format.

An example of the original data structure (simulated from `french_fries.dat` description):
```
   time  treatment  subject  rep  potato  buttery  grassy
0     1          1        3    1     2.9      0.0     0.0
... (more rows and columns for other attributes) ...
```

We want to transform this into a "long" table like:
```
   time  treatment  subject  rep   scale  score
0     1          1        3    1  potato    2.9
1     1          1        3    1 buttery    0.0
2     1          1        3    1  grassy    0.0
...
```
This is achieved by "melting" the attribute columns (`potato`, `buttery`, etc.) into two new columns: `scale` (containing the attribute name) and `score` (containing the value).

```python
# Assuming french_fries.dat is available and tab-delimited
# ffm = pd.read_csv("french_fries.dat", delimiter='\t')
# print("Original French Fries DataFrame (head):")
# print(ffm.head())

# melted_ffm = ffm.melt(
#     id_vars=['time', 'treatment', 'subject', 'rep'], # Columns to keep as identifiers
#     var_name='scale',                               # Name for the new 'variable' column
#     value_name='score'                              # Name for the new 'value' column
# )
# print("\nMelted French Fries DataFrame (head):")
# print(melted_ffm.head())
```

!!! question "Exercise: Melting Cake Data"
    Read in the `cake.dat` data. This file typically has a wide format where different bakers' ratings or measurements are in separate columns (e.g., `baker1`, `baker2`). Melt it to a long table with a structure similar to this example:

    ```
    cr  fr  variable  value
    1   1   baker1    7.5
    2   1   baker1    6.1
    1   1   baker2    4.2
    2   1   baker2    3.7
    1   2   baker3    3.8
    ...
    ```
    You'll need to identify which columns are `id_vars` (likely `cr` and `fr`) and which ones should be melted (the baker columns). The new column for baker identifiers could be named `variable` (as in the example) or something more descriptive like `baker_id`, and the new column for their scores would be `value`.

## Grouping Data with `groupby`

A common data operation is to split a DataFrame into groups based on some criteria and then apply a function (like sum, mean, count) to each group. Pandas provides the `groupby()` method for this powerful "split-apply-combine" pattern.

Let's use the classic Iris dataset as an example. We can group the flower samples by their `type`.

```python
# Ensure iris.data is available (e.g., in a subdirectory "./iris/")
# It typically has no header, and columns are:
# sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width, type
column_names = ["sepal_length", "sepal_width", "petal_length", "petal_width", "type"]
# irisdata = pd.read_csv(
#     "./iris/iris.data",
#     names=column_names,
#     header=None
# )
# print("Iris DataFrame (head):")
# print(irisdata.head())

# iris_group = irisdata.groupby("type")

# To see the size of each group (number of rows):
# print("\nSize of each group:")
# print(iris_group.size())

# To calculate the mean of all numeric columns for each group:
# print("\nMean values per group:")
# print(iris_group.mean())
```

!!! note "Understanding GroupBy Objects"
    Applying `groupby()` doesn't immediately create multiple new DataFrames. Instead, it creates a `DataFrameGroupBy` object. This object holds information about how the rows are allocated to different groups. You don't typically use this object directly for its grouping information but rather apply aggregation methods (like `sum()`, `mean()`, `count()`, `size()`, `min()`, `max()`, `std()`, `agg()`, `apply()`) to it. These methods operate on each group independently and then intelligently combine the results into a new Series or DataFrame.

Try out various aggregation methods that can be applied to a `GroupBy` object like `iris_group` (e.g., `median()`, `describe()`) and observe how they provide insights for each flower type.

## Other Useful DataFrame Methods

There are several other DataFrame methods that are essential for data cleaning and preparation. We won’t introduce these methods in detail here, but please read their documentation and practice using them:

*   `dropna()`: Removes missing values (NaN). You can specify how (any or all missing) and along which axis (rows or columns).
*   `drop_duplicates()`: Removes duplicate rows, optionally based on a subset of columns.
*   `reset_index()`: Resets the DataFrame index to a default integer index. Often, the old index is added as a new column.

## Practice Exercises

!!! question "Exercise: Course Enrollment Analysis"
    **Scenario:** We want to count how many people selected courses from different channels (e.g., online vs. onsite) and different class types using data from a `course_form.csv` file. We can rely on the `groupby()` method combined with an aggregation like `count()` or `size()`.

    **Explanation:** In this type of analysis, an aggregation function (like `count()` or `size()`) is applied to each group formed by `groupby()`. The groups effectively behave as if they were separate DataFrames for the aggregation step, and then the results are combined into a new Series or DataFrame.

    First, load the data (assuming `course_form.csv` is available):
    ```python
    # course_form = pd.read_csv("./course_form.csv")
    # print("Course Form Data (sample):")
    # print(course_form.head())
    ```

    To count enrollments based on `class` and `form` (assuming these are columns in your CSV):
    ```python
    # enrollment_counts = course_form.groupby(["class", "form"]).size()
    # The .size() method counts the number of rows in each group.
    # Alternatively, to count non-null values in a specific column per group:
    # enrollment_counts_specific_col = course_form.groupby(["class", "form"])['student_id'].count()

    # print("\nEnrollment counts by class and form:")
    # print(enrollment_counts)
    ```
    The original notes mentioned `course_form.groupby(["class","form"]).count()`. This would return the count of non-null values for *all other columns* for each group. Using `.size()` is often more direct for just getting group sizes.

!!! question "Exercise: Further Analysis Tasks"
    Now, please perform additional analyses based on the `course_form.csv` data or any other dataset provided. (The specific instructions for this exercise were incomplete in the original notes, so this is a placeholder for further tasks). For example, you could try to:

    1.  Using `course_form.csv`, calculate the average `score` (if such a column exists) for each combination of `class` and `form`.
    2.  Find the most popular `class` based on the total number of enrollments.
    3.  If the dataset contains timestamps, group by month and analyze trends.

## Case Study I: GDP Data Analysis from stats.gov.cn

!!! info "Background: National Economic Data"
    The National Bureau of Statistics of China provides a wealth of information regarding the country’s economy, particularly macroeconomic balances. For instance, GDP data by province and by sector are readily available. While we have previously worked with consumption and income data, those datasets were pre-processed. Now, we will engage with the raw data.

!!! question "Exercise 6: Macroeconomic Data Aggregation and Analysis"
    For this exercise, you will need four files: `consumption.csv`, `cpi.csv`, `gpd.csv`, and `population.csv`.

    1.  Read in these datasets and perform necessary transformations to consolidate all information into a single DataFrame.
        !!! note "Important Tip"
            When adding new columns, ensure that the data alignment and order are correct.
    2.  Compute the total savings for each province in each year. Store the resulting DataFrame in a "long" format.
        !!! note "Format Consideration"
            While you could store this data in a "wide" format, doing so might complicate subsequent operations.
    3.  We know that the price of products changes every year, as indicated by the consumer price index (CPI). The file `cpi.csv` contains the price index relative to 2013 (in 2013 Yuan) over the years. Please adjust the total savings of each province by this price index. We call the adjusted savings “real savings.”
    4.  What’s the average real savings of each province across the years?
    5.  Which province saves the most on average?

## Case Study II: Analyzing Returns of Individual Stocks

!!! warning "Advanced Exercise"
    This exercise presents a higher level of difficulty!

The file `stock_utf.csv` contains daily information for 10 listed stocks on the Chinese stock market from 1990 to 2000. This dataset is a subsample of the entire market but serves as a practical example. It includes 75 variables (columns), though not all will be used.

!!! question "Exercise 7: Individual Stock Return Calculation"
    1.  Examine the dataset: What are the variables (column names)?
    2.  We focus on `PrevClPr` (Previous Closing Price) and `Clpr` (Closing Price). Please create a new DataFrame to only include relevant columns (e.g., stock identifier, date, `PrevClPr`, `Clpr`).
    3.  We have previously learned how to construct momentum using monthly return data. Now, create returns from the new DataFrame. It’s defined as:
        `Clpr / PrevClPr`
    4.  Please compute the cumulative return every 5 days for each stock.

## Case Study III: Calculating Market Return

The file `Chinese_market.csv` is used for this study.
!!! info "Data Characteristics"
    This file purportedly contains data for all Chinese listed firms. However, due to privacy concerns, significant noise has been intentionally added to the original data.

It includes the following columns:

*   `stkcd`: Stock code
*   `trdmnt`: Trading month
*   `mclsprc`: Closing price for the month
*   `msmvttl`: Total market value

Our objective is to compute the weighted (by total market value) average of closing price of all the firms in each month. This weighted average shows us how the stock market performs as a large portfolio.

# Example V: Portfolio Returns

## Introduction

We will now explore the computation of portfolio returns, which can be more complex than individual asset returns. This section builds upon concepts related to financial data analysis, potentially using data files such as `FT50.xlsx`, which contains information on the Financial Times 50 index composites.

The primary goal is to construct various stock portfolios based on specific criteria (like market capitalization) and then calculate their respective returns.

!!! question "Preliminary Exercise: Weighted Average for FT50 Subset"
    Using data from the `FT50.xlsx` file (specifically, focusing on FT50 composites related to the Chinese market, if applicable), please select a subset of these firms and compute the weighted average of their relevant financial metric (e.g., price or return, as appropriate to the context of "weighted average").  

## Portfolio Construction Methodology

To analyze portfolio returns, we first need to construct the portfolios. A common approach involves dividing the entire stock universe into several groups based on certain characteristics. Here, we will focus on market capitalization.

The general steps are:

1.  **Define the Stock Universe**: Start with a defined set of stocks (e.g., those listed in `FT50.xlsx`).
2.  **Select Ranking Criterion**: For our purposes, we will use the **log of the market value** of stocks. This is often done on a periodic basis (e.g., monthly).
3.  **Form Portfolios (Deciles)**:
    *   Rank all stocks according to the chosen criterion (log market value) for each period.
    *   Divide the ranked stocks into ten equal parts (deciles).
    *   The largest 10% of stocks (by log market value) are grouped together to form the first portfolio.
    *   The next group, comprising stocks from the 10th to 20th percentile, forms the second portfolio, and so on, until ten distinct portfolios are created.
4.  **Calculate Portfolio Returns**: Once portfolios are formed for a period, the return for each portfolio is typically calculated as the simple average of the returns of the constituent stocks within that portfolio for that period.

!!! note "What is a Portfolio?"
    In this context, a portfolio is simply a collection of stocks. The "portfolio return" refers to the collective performance of these stocks, often calculated as an average of their individual returns.

## Calculating Portfolio Returns: Step-by-Step

Let's break down the process into specific tasks.

### Gross Returns for Individual Stocks

Before calculating portfolio returns, you usually need the returns for each individual stock.

!!! question "Exercise: Calculate Monthly Gross Returns"
    For each stock available in your dataset (e.g., from `FT50.xlsx`), please find its gross return for each month.  

### Portfolio Construction Based on Market Value (Average Price Focus)

This exercise focuses on forming portfolios and calculating the average *price* of the stocks within them, which is a different metric than portfolio *return*.

!!! question "Exercise: Portfolios by Market Value (Average Price)"
    1. For each month, construct ten portfolios based on the **market value** of the stocks.
    2. For each of these ten portfolios, compute the simple average of the *price* of its constituent stocks.  

    !!! info "Focus on Price, Not Return"
        Note that this exercise asks for the average *price* of the stocks within each portfolio, not the average return. This can be useful for understanding the general price level of stocks in different market value segments.

### Portfolio Construction Based on Log Market Value (Average Return Focus)

This is the core task for calculating portfolio returns based on market capitalization deciles.

!!! question "Exercise: Portfolios by Log Market Value (Average Return)"
    1. For each month:
        a. Rank all stocks based on the **log of their market value**.
        b. Construct ten distinct portfolios by dividing the ranked stocks into deciles. (e.g., the top 10% of stocks by log market value form Portfolio 1, the next 10% form Portfolio 2, and so on).
    2. For each portfolio in each month:
        a. Compute the simple average of the *returns* of its constituent stocks. This will result in a monthly return series for each of the ten portfolios.  

### Analyzing Overall Portfolio Performance

Once you have the monthly return series for each portfolio, you can analyze their overall performance.

!!! question "Exercise: Calculate Average Portfolio Series Returns"
    Using the monthly return series you computed for each of the ten portfolios (from the previous exercise), please find the average return for each portfolio series over the entire observation period.  
    This will give you a single average return figure for Portfolio 1, Portfolio 2, ..., Portfolio 10.

    *   Data organization principles.
    *   The pandas library for data manipulation.
    *   Understanding pandas `DataFrame` as a 2D NumPy array with row and column information.
    *   Fetching (extracting) rows and columns from a `DataFrame`.

    *   Creating new columns in a `DataFrame`.

## Working with Data: An Introduction

Welcome! Having covered the basics of Python, we now embark on our journey into working with datasets. A dataset is a collection where data is stored. Since most datasets are presented in a tabular format, we often use the terms "datasets" and "data tables" interchangeably. The `pandas` module is a powerful Python library specifically designed for analyzing data tables.

Data tables are crucial carriers of information. However, this information isn't always self-evident; we need to analyze the data to uncover its underlying insights.

By examining a data table, you will learn to:

*   Understand its organization: what the rows and columns represent.
*   Apply basic manipulations to extract information.

These manipulations enable us to:

*   View data from different perspectives by altering the table's format.
*   Pinpoint specific characteristics or entries by locating them within the table.
*   Segment the data table into smaller groups and summarize information within each group.

## Data Organization Principles

In fields like economics, working with data is essential. Data allows us to:

*   Gain insights into how the economic world operates.
*   Verify economic theories.

Examples of such data include a country's GDP, a person's consumption details, or the price of an item. With advancements in computing power, economic datasets are growing significantly, often reaching several gigabytes or even terabytes in size.

In computing, data is typically stored in tables. A table is analogous to a 2D matrix, comprising rows (horizontal elements) and columns (vertical elements).

Key principles for organizing data in tables include:

*   **Each row represents an observational unit:** This could be an entity like a person, a country, etc.
*   **Each column exhibits a perspective or characteristic of the rows:** For example, a person's height or a country's GDP.
*   **The top row is often reserved for column names (header):** This row is descriptive and not part of the actual data content.
*   **The first column is often reserved for row indices (names):** Similar to the header, this is for identification and not part of the data content.

## Pandas Series: A Single Column

Pandas handles sequence data in a manner similar to NumPy, using a 1-D sequence. However, in pandas, this structure is called a **Series**.

!!! note "Key Characteristics of a Pandas Series"
    *   **Homogeneous Data Type:** All elements within a Series must be of the same data type.
    *   **Named Index:** A crucial distinction is that elements in a Series have names, referred to as the **index**. We can also say that the data points in a Series are "indexed."

## Pandas DataFrame: Processing Tables

The primary data structure in pandas for storing and manipulating tabular data is the **DataFrame**. Conceptually, a DataFrame is like a matrix but with added features for labeling:

*   **Index:** Contains the names (labels) for each row.
*   **Columns:** Contains the names (labels) for each column.

!!! note "Key Concept: DataFrame"
    A pandas `DataFrame` can be thought of as a 2D NumPy array enhanced with descriptive row indices and column names.

For example, let's create a DataFrame. In the output of the following code, the boldfaced numbers on the leftmost side (0 to 5) would be the index, and the boldfaced letters ('A' through 'D') on top would be the column names, as described in the original notes.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

df1 = pd.DataFrame(
    np.random.randn(6, 4),  # Generates data from a standard normal distribution N(0,1)
    index=range(6),
    columns=list("ABCD")
)
# To see the DataFrame, you would typically print it or display it in an environment
# like Jupyter Notebook:
# print(df1)
```

### Accessing Rows and Columns

We can extract (or "look up") rows and columns from a DataFrame using their names or positions. However, the methods for indexing rows and columns differ.

**Example: Extracting a Row Slice and a Column**

```python
# Assuming df1 from the previous example
row1_slice = df1[0:1]  # Slicing rows by position; result is a DataFrame
col1 = df1['A']       # Selecting a column by name; result is a Series

# You can inspect these:
# print("Row slice (DataFrame):")
# print(row1_slice)
# print("\nColumn (Series):")
# print(col1)
```

!!! info "Understanding Slicing vs. Selection"
    When you slice rows like `df1[0:1]`, the result is still a `DataFrame`, even if it contains only one row.
    When you select a single column like `df1['A']`, the result is a `pandas.Series`.

Although they might appear similar in some outputs, rows (or row slices) and columns (as Series) are fundamentally different objects. You can verify their types:

```python
print(type(row1_slice))
print(type(col1))
```
The output for `type(col1)` will show `<class 'pandas.core.series.Series'>`, indicating that `col1` is a Series. A Series is a 1-D labeled array capable of holding data of any type, representing a single aspect (column) of a DataFrame. A pandas `DataFrame` can be seen as a collection of these Series objects, sharing a common index.

The DataFrame provides structured information. For instance, observe the data generated by `np.random.randn(6,4)` in `df1`.

!!! info "Data Types Observation"
    You might notice that even if a number looks like an integer (e.g., `1.0` if it appeared), its underlying data type in `df1` (created with `randn`) will be a float. This is because `np.random.randn` generates floating-point numbers.
    Understanding data types is crucial for accurate analysis and avoiding unexpected behavior.

We can get analytical information about each column using the `describe()` method and information about the storage data types with the `.dtypes` attribute.

Streaming response: # Processing a Single Table with Pandas

This chapter covers essential Pandas operations for processing and transforming data within a single DataFrame. We will explore how to inspect, sort, aggregate, reshape, and select data effectively.

## Initial DataFrame Exploration and Creation

Pandas DataFrames come with built-in methods for quick exploration. For instance, the `describe()` method provides descriptive statistics of the numerical columns, and the `dtypes` attribute shows the data type of each column.

Here's how you can create a simple DataFrame:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

df2 = pd.DataFrame([[1, 2], [1.1, 2.1]], index=range(2), columns=['col1', 'col2'])

# Example usage of dtypes and describe:
# To see the data types:
# print(df2.dtypes)
# To get descriptive statistics:
# print(df2.describe())
```

## Modifying DataFrame Presentation

While the underlying data might not change, altering its presentation can help highlight specific aspects you are interested in.

### Sorting Data

One common way to highlight important information is by arranging it at the top of the table. This is achieved using the `sort_values()` method (for sorting by column values) or the `sort_index()` method (for sorting by the DataFrame's index).

Here's an example demonstrating sorting:

```python
race_score = pd.DataFrame([['Alice', 15.6], ['Bob', 17.3], ['Charlie', 14.5]])
# print("Original race_score:")
# print(race_score)

# Sort by the values in the second column (index 1) in ascending order
race_score_sorted_values = race_score.sort_values(by=1, ascending=True)
# print("\nSorted by values in column 1:")
# print(race_score_sorted_values)

# To demonstrate sort_index, we first assign a new, unsorted index to the original race_score
race_score.index = [1002, 1001, 1003]
# print("\nrace_score with new index:")
# print(race_score)

# Sort by the index
race_score_sorted_index = race_score.sort_index()
# print("\nSorted by index:")
# print(race_score_sorted_index)
```

!!! note "Sorting Methods"
    - `sort_values(by=column_label_or_index, ascending=True/False)`: Sorts the DataFrame by its values in one or more specified columns.
    - `sort_index(ascending=True/False)`: Sorts the DataFrame by its index labels.

### Aggregating Data

When you need a high-level overview of your data, summarization through aggregation is key. Instead of focusing on individual records, aggregation provides insights into the overall data characteristics using functions like mean, sum, count, etc. This is commonly done with the `agg()` method.

Here's an example of data aggregation:

```python
student_name = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David', 'Eva']
language_score = [99, 100, 35, 60, 71]
math_score = [25, 89, 36, 40, 91]

score = pd.DataFrame(
    np.array([language_score, math_score]).T,
    index=student_name,
    columns=['language', 'math']
)
# print("Original scores:")
# print(score)

# Calculate the mean score for each subject (aggregation along columns, axis=0)
mean_scores_per_subject = score.agg("mean", axis=0)
# print("\nMean scores per subject:")
# print(mean_scores_per_subject)

# Calculate the total score for each student (aggregation along rows, axis=1)
total_score_per_student = score.agg("sum", axis=1)
# print("\nTotal score per student:")
# print(total_score_per_student)
```

## Reading Data from Files

Pandas offers a straightforward way to read data from various file formats, with CSV files being one of the most common. The `pd.read_csv()` function is a versatile tool for this purpose.

```python
# Example: Reading the Iris dataset.
# Ensure the file path "./iris/iris.data" is correct relative to your working directory.
# irisdata = pd.read_csv("./iris/iris.data", header=None)
# print(irisdata.head())
```

!!! info "Using `pd.read_csv()`"
    `pd.read_csv()` can handle many options. For instance, `header=None` is used when the CSV file lacks a header row, prompting Pandas to assign default integer column names (0, 1, 2,...).

!!! question "In-class Exercise 1: Iris Data Preprocessing"
    1.  Read in the data from `"./iris/iris.data"` (assume it has no header row). Take a quick look at the data. What are the default column names?
    2.  Change the column names to: `"sepal_length"`, `"sepal_width"`, `"petal_length"`, `"petal_width"`, and `"type"`.
    3.  Remove the last column, `"type"`. (Hint: investigate the `drop()` method.)
    4.  Compute (aggregate) the mean and standard deviation for each of the first four numeric columns.
    5.  Create a new DataFrame called `"irisdata_normed"` by performing standardization on the first four columns: subtract the column's mean from each value in that column, and then divide by the column's standard deviation.
    6.  Check the mean and standard deviation of each column in `irisdata_normed`. What values do you expect for the mean and standard deviation after standardization?
    7.  Write the `irisdata_normed` DataFrame to a new CSV file named `iris_normalized.csv`. (Hint: use the `to_csv()` method, and consider the `index` parameter.)

## Reshaping Data Structures

Beyond changing how data *appears*, we can also change its *structure*. Swapping rows and columns is a powerful way to reorganize data for different analytical perspectives without altering the actual data values (unlike aggregation). This is often done using `stack()` and `unstack()` methods.

### Stacking and Unstacking DataFrames

**Multi-level Indexing**

A DataFrame's index uniquely identifies its rows. Sometimes, a single identifier isn't enough, and we need multiple levels of identification (a `MultiIndex`). For example, a student named "Alice" in "Class 1" of "Grade 1" is distinct from an "Alice" in "Class 2" of "Grade 3". A `MultiIndex` helps manage such hierarchical Naming.

Consider an example where we record height and weight for selected students from different grades and classes:

```python
arrays = [
    ["first", "first", "second", "second", "third", "third", "fourth", "fourth"],
    ["one", "two", "one", "two", "one", "two", "one", "two"],
]
height_weight = np.array([
    [173, 176, 185, 167, 165, 193, 156, 163],  # heights
    [130, 190, 180, 170, 170, 200, 100, 105]   # weights
]).T

# Create a MultiIndex from arrays
# For more details, see: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.MultiIndex.from_arrays.html
myindex = pd.MultiIndex.from_arrays(arrays, names=["grade", "class"])

student_info = pd.DataFrame(height_weight, index=myindex, columns=["height", "weight"])
# print("Original DataFrame (student_info):")
# print(student_info)

# Stack the DataFrame: moves columns to become the innermost index level
stacked_info = student_info.stack()
# print("\nStacked DataFrame (stacked_info):")
# print(stacked_info)

# Unstack the DataFrame: moves an index level (or levels) to become column headers
# Example: unstacking by levels [1,2] (0-indexed from the outermost index) from the stacked_info
# This will unstack 'class' (original index level 1) and the measurement type (original columns, now index level 2)
unstacked_info_example = stacked_info.unstack([1, 2])
# print("\nUnstacked DataFrame (from stacked_info, unstacking levels 1 and 2):")
# print(unstacked_info_example)

# A more common unstack operation might be to unstack the innermost level of the stacked DataFrame
# unstacked_from_stacked = stacked_info.unstack()
# print("\nUnstacked from stacked_info (default, unstacking innermost level):")
# print(unstacked_from_stacked)
```

!!! note "Understanding `stack()` and `unstack()`"
    - `stack()`: "Pivots" a level of the column labels to become the innermost level of a `MultiIndex` on the rows. This typically makes the DataFrame "taller" (more rows, fewer columns).
    - `unstack()`: "Pivots" a level of the row index to become a new level of column labels. This typically makes the DataFrame "wider" (fewer rows, more columns).

## Advanced Data Selection

While basic square bracket indexing (`[]`) can be used for simple selections, it has limitations:

*   It uses different mechanisms for row and column selection.
*   Selecting multiple, non-contiguous rows or columns can be awkward.
*   Slicing columns is not directly supported with single `[]`.
*   Complex, multi-step selections can be error-prone and may trigger `SettingWithCopyWarning`.

For robust and clear data selection, Pandas provides the `.loc[]` (label-based) and `.iloc[]` (integer position-based) accessors.

### Precise Selection with .loc and .iloc

These accessors offer a more explicit and powerful way to select data.

**Examples using `.loc` and `.iloc` with the `student_info` DataFrame:**

```python
# Assuming student_info DataFrame from the previous section is available
# print("Original student_info DataFrame:")
# print(student_info)

# Using .loc to select by label:
# Get the 'height' of the student in 'second' grade, 'one' class
height_second_one = student_info.loc[('second', 'one'), 'height']
# print(f"\nHeight of student ('second', 'one') using .loc: {height_second_one}")

# Using .iloc to select by integer position:
# The student ('second', 'one') is at row index 2 (0-indexed). 'height' is column index 0.
height_iloc_example = student_info.iloc[2, 0]
# print(f"Height using .iloc[2, 0]: {height_iloc_example}")

# Advanced selection with .loc using a callable (lambda function):
# Select all data for students with height greater than 160 and less than 180
selected_students = student_info.loc[lambda df: (df['height'] > 160) & (df['height'] < 180), :]
# print("\nStudents with height > 160 and < 180 (exclusive of 180):")
# print(selected_students)
```

!!! info "Choosing Between `.loc` and `.iloc`"
    - Use `.loc[]` when you want to select data based on index labels or column names. It accepts boolean arrays for filtering rows. Slices are inclusive of the end label.
    - Use `.iloc[]` when you want to select data based on integer positions (like Python list slicing). Slices are exclusive of the end position.
    Both methods support selecting single values, rows, columns, slices, and lists of labels/positions.

## Applied Data Analysis Exercises

### Example: Income Data

!!! question "In-class Exercise 2: Income and Consumption Analysis"
    1.  You are given two files: `income.csv` and `consumption.csv`. These files contain per capita income and per capita consumption data by province, respectively, along with population figures.
    2.  For each dataset, create new columns to calculate the total income and total consumption for each province in each year. Save these modified DataFrames to new files (e.g., `income_total.csv` and `consumption_total.csv`). Consider the units of these new columns (e.g., if per capita income is in USD, total income will also be in USD).
    3.  How would you compute the savings ratio for each province and year? (Savings are defined as the portion of income not used for consumption: Savings = Income - Consumption. The savings ratio is typically Savings / Income).

### Example: Production Function Data

!!! question "In-class Exercise 3: Production Function Analysis (Details to Follow)"
    Another common application of data analysis involves studying production functions.

Streaming response: # Advanced Data Operations in AI Programming

This section covers several exercises focused on common data manipulation and analysis tasks encountered in AI programming, particularly with economic and financial datasets. These include handling time-series data, aligning inputs, calculating derived metrics, and performing aggregations.

## Analyzing Production Function Data

### Understanding Input-Output Alignment

In economic analysis, particularly when examining production functions, it's crucial to ensure that inputs and outputs are correctly aligned in time. A common representation of the Cobb-Douglas production function is:

Y<sub>t</sub> = A<sub>t</sub>K<sub>t</sub><sup>&alpha;</sup>L<sub>t</sub><sup>1-&alpha;</sup>

Where:
-   Y<sub>t</sub> is the output at time t
-   A<sub>t</sub> is the total factor productivity at time t
-   K<sub>t</sub> is the capital input at time t
-   L<sub>t</sub> is the labor input at time t
-   &alpha; is the output elasticity of capital

A common issue, known as a lead/lag problem, arises from financial reporting standards. Firms typically disclose financial statements at the end of a fiscal year. This means:
-   Output (Y<sub>t</sub>) often represents total output *over* the year.
-   Labor (L<sub>t</sub>) might be the number of employees at the *end* of the year.
-   Capital (K<sub>t</sub>) is also typically reported as the stock at the *end* of the year.

This creates a misalignment: end-of-period capital stock (K<sub>t</sub>) is used to model output (Y<sub>t</sub>) generated throughout period t. Ideally, the capital used for production during period t would be the capital available at the *beginning* of period t (i.e., K<sub>t-1</sub>) or an average measure.

!!! info "Aligning Inputs with `shift`"
    To address this misalignment, we often use a `shift` operation on the data. For capital, this means using the previous period's capital (K<sub>t-1</sub>) as the input for the current period's output (Y<sub>t</sub>). For labor, since its contribution can be continuous and we may not be sure which specific measure is most accurate, an average of the current year's and the previous year's labor figures (`(L<sub>t</sub> + L<sub>t-1</sub>)/2`) is often a more robust measure.

!!! question "Exercise: Production Function Analysis"
    The file `cdprod.xlsx` contains capital, labor, and output information collected from a hypothetical capital-intensive firm from 2000 to 2021. Note that the output for the year 2000 is missing.  

    1.  Write a Python function to find the return-to-scale on capital (&alpha;) **without** correcting for the time alignment of inputs.
        !!! hint
            You can write a `for` loop to iterate through possible values of &alpha; and find the one that produces output closest to the observed output.  
    2.  Correctly align the capital and labor inputs as discussed (use lagged capital, K<sub>t-1</sub>, and average labor, (L<sub>t</sub> + L<sub>t-1</sub>)/2). Then, redo step 1 to find &alpha; with the aligned data.  

## Exploring Financial Time Series: Momentum

### The Concept of Momentum in Asset Pricing

In asset pricing theory, "momentum" is an important concept. It describes the empirical tendency for assets that have performed well in the recent past to continue performing well, and conversely, for assets that have performed poorly to continue performing poorly. This phenomenon provides clues about future stock returns based on past return information.

By definition for this exercise, momentum (m<sub>t</sub>) at time t is calculated as:

m<sub>t</sub> = &Pi;<sub>j=2 to 12</sub> r<sub>t-j</sub>

Where r<sub>t</sub> is the return at time t. This specific formula calculates the product of returns over an 11-month period, specifically from month t-2 to month t-12 (effectively skipping the most recent month, t-1).

!!! note "Interpreting the Momentum Formula"
    The formula m<sub>t</sub> = &Pi;<sub>j=2 to 12</sub> r<sub>t-j</sub> involves multiplying simple returns. It's important to be aware of how returns (r<sub>t</sub>) are defined in your dataset (e.g., simple returns `(P_t/P_{t-1}) - 1` or log returns `ln(P_t/P_{t-1})`). While other definitions of momentum exist, for this exercise, please adhere strictly to the formula provided.

!!! question "Exercise: Calculating Stock Momentum"

    1.  The file `return1.csv` contains information about the returns of one firm. Please compute its momentum (m<sub>t</sub>) for all periods where data are available, using the formula defined above.
        !!! hint
            The `rolling()` method in pandas can be very useful for calculations over a moving window. You might need to combine it with a custom function using `.apply()` to compute the product over the window.  

    2.  The file `return4.csv` contains return information for four different firms.
        1.  Examine the data. Calculate the cross-sectional average return for each time period (i.e., the average return of the four firms at each point in time). Then, calculate the time-series average of these cross-sectional average returns.
        2.  Read in the data. Check if any data cleaning or transformation steps are necessary before analysis (e.g., handling missing values, reshaping data if needed).
        3.  Compute the momentum (m<sub>t</sub>) for each of the four firms for all periods where data are available, using the same formula.  

## Analyzing Cross-Sectional and Grouped Data

### Aggregating Economic Data: GDP by Sector and Country

Economic datasets often have multiple dimensions, such as time, geographical region (e.g., country), and economic sector. Aggregation is a common and essential task to summarize this data and derive meaningful insights. For example, we might want to understand the average Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for each country across all its sectors, or the average GDP for each economic sector across multiple countries.

!!! question "Exercise: Sectoral GDP Analysis"
    The file `country_sector.xlsx` contains sector-level Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data for four countries.  

    1.  Calculate the average GDP per country (i.e., for each country, find the average of its GDP across all listed sectors).
    2.  Calculate the average GDP per sector (i.e., for each sector, find the average of its GDP across all four countries).

Streaming response: # NumPy and Pandas Essentials

This chapter introduces NumPy, a fundamental package for numerical computation in Python, and sets the stage for Pandas. We'll explore array structures, essential functions, and the power of vectorization.

## What You Will Learn
- A new and more general data structure: the array.
- NumPy's core data structure: the `ndarray`.
- Basic NumPy functions for array creation and manipulation.
- Performing matrix operations with NumPy.
- Understanding NumPy's broadcasting mechanism.
- How vectorization accelerates computations.

!!! info "Reading Function Documentation"
    To fully leverage NumPy (and later, Pandas), you’ll often need to consult the official documentation for various functions and their parameters. A good starting point is the [NumPy user guide](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/).

## The NumPy Module

It's been a while since we last used the `conda` environment. Let's ensure NumPy and Pandas are installed. Open your terminal or Anaconda Prompt and run the following commands if you haven't installed these packages yet:

```bash
# (base) C:\Users\yourusername>conda install numpy
# (base) C:\Users\yourusername>conda install pandas
```

!!! note "Focus of this Chapter"
    While we will primarily use Pandas in subsequent data analysis tasks, a solid understanding of basic NumPy operations is crucial as Pandas is built on top of NumPy. This chapter covers a foundational subset of NumPy's capabilities.

### Understanding `ndarray`

We've previously learned that complex data types in Python, like lists or tuples, can hold several elements, which can even be of different types. NumPy's `ndarray` (n-dimensional array) introduces a more specialized sequence type optimized for numerical operations.

!!! quote "NumPy Array Definition"
    According to the NumPy documentation, "In computer programming, an array is a structure for storing and retrieving data."

Two key features of NumPy arrays ( `ndarray`s) are:

*   **Fixed Size:** The number of elements in an array is fixed upon its creation.
*   **Homogeneous Type:** All elements within an array must be of the same data type (e.g., all integers, all floats).

### Creating Arrays
Let’s create some `ndarray`s. We can specify the data type of the elements using the `dtype` parameter.

```python
import numpy as np

# Creating a simple array
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
print("Array a:", a)
print("Data type of a:", a.dtype)

# Array with mixed types (NumPy will upcast to a common type, here strings)
b = np.array([1, 2, 'a'])
print("\nArray b:", b)
print("Data type of b:", b.dtype)

# Creating an array of arrays (potentially of different types/shapes)
# For this, dtype=object is often needed to maintain sub-array integrity
# Here, 'a' is an array of integers, and 'b' is an array of strings
c = np.array([a, b], dtype=object)
print("\nArray c (dtype=object):", c)
print("Element 0 of c:", c[0])
print("Element 1 of c:", c[1])

# Explicitly setting dtype during creation
a_float = np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=float)
print("\nArray a_float:", a_float)
print("Data type of a_float:", a_float.dtype)
```

!!! question "Exercise 1: Basic Array Statistics"
    Given the tuple `t1 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)`:
    1. Convert `t1` to a NumPy array.
    2. Write a function (or use NumPy built-ins) to compute the average of the elements in the array.
    3. Write a function (or use NumPy built-ins) to compute the standard deviation of the elements.
    4. (Optional Challenge) Write a function (or find a SciPy function) to compute the skewness of the elements.
    
    ```python
    t1 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    
    # Your code here
    # Example for average:
    # import numpy as np
    # arr_t1 = np.array(t1)
    # average = np.mean(arr_t1)
    # print(f"Average: {average}")
    ```

### Special Array Creation Functions
NumPy provides several convenient functions to create `ndarray`s with specific initial values or patterns:

*   `np.ones(shape, dtype=None)`: Creates an array of the given shape, filled with ones.
*   `np.zeros(shape, dtype=None)`: Creates an array of the given shape, filled with zeros.
*   `np.eye(N, M=None, k=0, dtype=float)`: Creates a 2-D array with ones on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere (an identity matrix if N=M).
*   `np.random.random(size=None)` or `np.random.rand(d0, d1, ..., dn)`: Creates an array with random floats in the half-open interval [0.0, 1.0).
*   `np.random.normal(loc=0.0, scale=1.0, size=None)`: Creates an array with random samples drawn from a normal (Gaussian) distribution.
*   `np.random.randint(low, high=None, size=None, dtype=int)`: Creates an array with random integers from `low` (inclusive) to `high` (exclusive).
*   `np.arange([start,] stop[, step,], dtype=None)`: Returns evenly spaced values within a given interval. Similar to Python's `range` but returns an `ndarray`.
*   `np.linspace(start, stop, num=50, endpoint=True, retstep=False, dtype=None)`: Returns `num` evenly spaced numbers over a specified interval `[start, stop]`.

!!! question "Exercise 2: Creating a 3D Array"
    Create a 3-D `ndarray` with dimensions 2x3x4. Each entry of this `ndarray` should follow a normal distribution with a mean of 5 and a standard deviation of 3.
    
    ```python
    # import numpy as np
    # mean = 5
    # std_dev = 3
    # shape = (2, 3, 4)
    # random_3d_array = np.random.normal(mean, std_dev, shape)
    # print(random_3d_array)
    ```

!!! question "Exercise 3: `arange` vs. `linspace`"
    What’s the key difference between `numpy.arange()` and `numpy.linspace()` in terms of how they generate sequences? When might you prefer one over the other?

### Vectorization: The Power of NumPy
One of the primary reasons NumPy is so popular and crucial in Python data analysis is its efficiency in numerical computations, especially for operations on entire arrays (vectors and matrices). This is achieved through **vectorization**. Vectorized operations in NumPy are implemented in C, making them much faster than equivalent operations performed using Python loops.

!!! quote "NumPy and Vectorization"
    Some authors have aptly stated, "NumPy is all about vectorization."

This means that operations are applied to all elements of an array simultaneously, or in highly optimized loops under the hood, rather than iterating element by element in Python.

#### Example: Performance Comparison (NumPy vs. List)
Let's see how much faster NumPy can be compared to standard Python lists for a simple numerical operation.

```python
import numpy as np
import time

size = 10_000_000
python_list = list(range(size))
numpy_array = np.arange(size)

# --- List timing ---
stime_list = time.perf_counter()
python_list_squared = [x**2 for x in python_list]
etime_list = time.perf_counter()
list_time = etime_list - stime_list
print(f"Time taken by list comprehension: {list_time:.5f} seconds")

# --- NumPy timing ---
stime_numpy = time.perf_counter()
numpy_array_squared = numpy_array ** 2  # Vectorized operation
etime_numpy = time.perf_counter()
numpy_time = etime_numpy - stime_numpy
print(f"Time taken by NumPy array: {numpy_time:.5f} seconds")

# --- Results ---
if numpy_time > 0:  # Avoid division by zero if numpy_time is extremely small
    print(f"NumPy is approximately {list_time / numpy_time:.2f} times faster than lists in this example.")
else:
    print("NumPy operation was too fast to measure reliably with this method, or an error occurred in timing.")
```

### Matrix Algebra with NumPy
NumPy excels at linear algebra operations. For example, adding two matrices is straightforward, provided their dimensions are compatible.

In linear algebra, if you have two matrices:
$$ M_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 4 & 5 & 6 \end{pmatrix}, \quad M_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 6 & 5 & 4 \\ 3 & 2 & 1 \end{pmatrix} $$
Their sum is:
$$ M_1 + M_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 1+6 & 2+5 & 3+4 \\ 4+3 & 5+2 & 6+1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 7 & 7 & 7 \\ 7 & 7 & 7 \end{pmatrix} $$

!!! question "Exercise 4: Matrix Addition"
    1. Represent `M1` and `M2` as Python lists of lists. Write a function to compute their sum using nested loops.
    2. Represent `M1` and `M2` as NumPy arrays. Compute their sum using NumPy's addition operator. Compare the simplicity of the code.

### Broadcasting
NumPy's **broadcasting** is a powerful mechanism that allows arithmetic operations on arrays of different shapes. Subject to certain constraints, the smaller array is "broadcast" across the larger array so that they have compatible shapes for the operation. This avoids the need to explicitly replicate the smaller array to match the larger one, leading to more efficient memory usage and cleaner code.

For example, we can add a 1D array (vector) to each row or column of a 2D array (matrix):

```python
import numpy as np

m1 = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
               [4, 5, 6],
               [7, 8, 9]])
v1 = np.array([1, 0, 1])  # A 1D array (shape (3,))

# Add v1 to each row of m1
m1_plus_v1 = m1 + v1
print("m1:\n", m1)
print("\nv1:", v1)
print("\nm1 + v1 (v1 broadcasted to each row of m1):\n", m1_plus_v1)

# To add v1 as a column, v1 needs to be a column vector (shape (3,1))
v_col = np.array([[10], [20], [30]]) # A 2D array (column vector, shape (3,1))
m1_plus_v_col = m1 + v_col
print("\nv_col (column vector):\n", v_col)
print("\nm1 + v_col (v_col broadcasted to each column of m1):\n", m1_plus_v_col)
```

!!! question "Exercise 5: Understanding Broadcasting Rules"
    1. In the context of NumPy broadcasting, what does it mean for array shapes to be "compatible"?
    2. Briefly describe the general rules NumPy follows to broadcast arrays during arithmetic operations. (Hint: Consider how dimensions are compared, starting from the trailing dimensions).

# Advanced NumPy Operations

This section delves deeper into NumPy's capabilities, covering matrix algebra, the power of vectorization, and the important distinction between array views and copies.

## NumPy for Matrix Algebra

NumPy is a cornerstone for numerical computation in Python, largely due to its efficient handling of multi-dimensional arrays and a rich set of functions for linear algebra.

### Broadcasting and Dimension Mismatches

When performing operations between arrays of different shapes, NumPy attempts to use a set of rules called "broadcasting." However, if the shapes are incompatible according to these rules, an error will occur.

Consider a scenario where array dimensions do not align for an operation:

```python
import numpy as np

m1 = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
v1 = np.array([1, 1]) # v1 has shape (2,)

# Attempting to add m1 (3x3) and v1 (2,)
# This will result in a ValueError because shapes are not compatible for broadcasting.
# m1 + v1
```

!!! note "Broadcasting Rule"
    For broadcasting to work, when comparing dimensions (starting from the trailing ones), either the dimensions must be equal, or one of them must be 1. If these conditions are not met, a `ValueError` is raised. In the example above, the trailing dimension of `m1` (3) does not match `v1`'s dimension (2), and neither is 1.

### Matrix Transposition

In linear algebra, transposing a matrix switches its rows and columns. NumPy provides a straightforward way to achieve this.

If we have a matrix $M_1$:
$$ M_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 \\ 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 \end{pmatrix} $$
Its transpose, $M_1^T$, would be:
$$ M_1^T = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 4 & 8 \\ 1 & 5 & 9 \\ 2 & 6 & 10 \\ 3 & 7 & 11 \end{pmatrix} $$

This can be done in NumPy using the `.T` attribute:

```python
m1 = np.array([
    [0, 1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6, 7],
    [8, 9, 10, 11]
])
m1T = m1.T
print("Original matrix m1:\n", m1)
print("Transposed matrix m1T:\n", m1T)
```

!!! question "Exercise: `numpy.transpose` vs. `.T`"
    There is a `numpy.transpose()` function. What’s the difference between using `numpy.transpose(m1)` and `m1.T`?  
    Investigate their functionalities and any potential differences in usage or behavior.

### Reshaping Arrays

The `numpy.ndarray` is highly flexible. We can use the `.reshape()` method to change the shape of an array without changing its data, provided the new shape is compatible with the original number of elements.

```python
m1 = np.array([
    [0, 1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6, 7],
    [8, 9, 10, 11]
]) # m1 has shape (3, 4), total 12 elements

# Reshape to a 1D array of 12 elements
m11 = m1.reshape(12)
print(m11, ":", m11.shape)

# Reshape to a 1D array (explicitly as a column vector in spirit, then row)
m12 = m1.reshape([12,])
print(m12, ":", m12.shape)

# Reshape to a 2D array (column vector) of shape (12, 1)
m13 = m1.reshape([12, 1])
print(m13.T, ":", m13.shape) # Transposed for printing, original shape is (12,1)

# Reshape to a 2D array of shape (2, 6)
m14 = m1.reshape([2, 6])
print(m14, ":", m14.shape) # Note: m14.T was in the original, printing m14 directly
```

## Revisit Vectorization

NumPy's speed largely comes from its vectorized operations. Vectorization allows operations to be applied to entire arrays at once, rather than element by element in Python loops.

Recall that attempting to add a number directly to a standard Python list results in an error:
```python
lst = [1, 2, 3]
# lst + 4 # This would raise a TypeError
```
With NumPy `ndarray`s, however, scalar operations are straightforward and efficient:
```python
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3])
result = arr + 4
print(result) # Output: [5 6 7]
```

### Universal Functions (Ufuncs)

More generally, NumPy provides universal functions (ufuncs), which are functions that operate on `ndarray`s in an element-by-element fashion. They are not only fast but also convenient to use. We've seen that list operations can be much slower than `ndarray` operations. Now, let's compare Python loops versus ufuncs when both are applied to an `ndarray`.

(Portions of the following code examples are adapted from the *Python Data Science Handbook* by Jake VanderPlas.)

Let's start with a "normal" Python function that uses a loop:

**Example: Timing Function Execution**

To measure performance, we can use a decorator to time function execution multiple times and report the average.

```python
import numpy as np
import time # Ensure time is imported for stime and etime

def timer_100(func):
    times = []
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        for _ in range(100): # Corrected loop variable
            stime = time.time()
            func(*args, **kwargs)
            etime = time.time() # Corrected variable name
            times.append(etime - stime)
        avg = np.mean(times)
        std = np.std(times)
        print(f"The average run time is {avg:.6f}s; the std is {std:.6f}s")
        # It's good practice for a wrapper to return the function's result
        # For this timing decorator, returning the result of the last call,
        # or None if the function doesn't return anything meaningful for timing.
        # For simplicity here, we are not returning the func's result.
    return wrapper

@timer_100
def compute_reciprocals(nums):
    output = np.empty(len(nums))
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        output[i] = 1.0 / nums[i]
    return output

# Test with a large array
# compute_reciprocals(np.random.randint(1, 10, size=10_000))
```

Now, let's perform the same operation using NumPy's vectorized approach (which implicitly uses a ufunc for division):

```python
@timer_100 # Applying the timer to the NumPy version as well for fair comparison
def numpy_reciprocals(nums):
    return 1.0 / nums

# Test with a large array
# random_numbers = np.random.randint(1, 10, size=10_000)
# print("Timing compute_reciprocals (loop-based):")
# compute_reciprocals(random_numbers)
# print("\nTiming numpy_reciprocals (vectorized):")
# numpy_reciprocals(random_numbers)
```
!!! info "Running the Timing Test"
    If you run the code above (uncommenting the test calls), you'll observe that `numpy_reciprocals` is significantly faster than `compute_reciprocals`. This highlights the performance benefits of vectorization.

!!! question "Exercise: Verify Correctness"
    Although we observed a significant time difference between `compute_reciprocals` and `numpy_reciprocals`, we haven't formally checked if their answers are correct and equivalent.  
    Write code to verify the correctness of these two functions. For instance, you can use `np.allclose()` to compare their outputs for a given input.

### Common and Specialized Ufuncs

Besides common arithmetic operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, which have ufunc equivalents (`np.add`, `np.subtract`, etc.), many commonly used mathematical functions are available as ufuncs. These include:

*   `np.abs` (absolute value)
*   Trigonometric functions: `np.sin`, `np.cos`, `np.tan`
*   Inverse trigonometric functions: `np.arcsin`, `np.arccos`, `np.arctan`
*   Exponential and logarithmic functions: `np.exp`, `np.log`

NumPy also provides more specialized ufuncs for numerical stability or specific mathematical needs. For example:

*   `np.expm1(x)` computes $e^x - 1$. This provides greater precision for small values of $x$ than `np.exp(x) - 1`.
*   `np.log1p(x)` computes $\log(1 + x)$. This provides greater precision for small values of $x$ than `np.log(1 + x)`.

### Creating Custom Ufuncs with `numpy.vectorize`

While NumPy offers an abundance of ufuncs, situations may arise where you need a custom operation not directly covered. NumPy provides `numpy.vectorize` to transform a Python function that works on scalars into a function that can operate on NumPy arrays in a vectorized manner.

!!! note "Performance of `numpy.vectorize`"
    It's important to understand that `numpy.vectorize` is primarily a convenience wrapper. It internally uses a Python loop, so it doesn't offer the same performance benefits as ufuncs written in C. However, it can simplify code by allowing you to write a function for scalars and apply it to arrays.

!!! question "Exercise: Custom Vectorized Function"
    1. Read the documentation for `numpy.vectorize`.
    2. Write your own Python function to compute $f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + x^2}$.
    3. Use `numpy.vectorize` to create a vectorized version of your function.
    4. Test the speed of your vectorized function on a NumPy array and compare it (e.g., using the `timer_100` decorator or `%timeit` in IPython/Jupyter) with a manually looped version and, if possible, a version written using only standard NumPy ufuncs (like `1.0 / (1.0 + x**2)`).

!!! question "Exercise: Array Operations - Min, Mean, and Masking"
    1. Read the documentation for the `min()` and `mean()` methods/functions in NumPy, paying attention to the `axis` parameter.
    2. Given the following `ndarray`:
       ```python
       arr = np.array([
           [1, 2, 3],
           [4, 5, 6],
           [7, 8, 9]
       ])
       ```
       Perform these operations:
       *   Create a boolean mask to select only those entries whose values are greater than 3.
       *   Find the minimum value of each row.
       *   Find the mean (average) of each column.

## View vs. Copy in NumPy

A potentially confusing but crucial aspect of NumPy is the distinction between a "view" and a "copy" of an array.

*   **View (Shallow Copy):** A view is a new array object that looks at the same data as the original array. No new data is created. If you modify a view, the original array's data will also change. Slicing an array often produces a view.
*   **Copy (Deep Copy):** A copy creates a new array object with its own data, duplicated from the original array. Modifications to a copy do not affect the original array, and vice-versa.

The main difference becomes apparent when you modify their contents.

**Example: Modifying a View**

Consider `y` as a slice (and thus, often a view) of `x`:
```python
x = np.arange(10)
print(f"Original x: {x}")

y = x[1:3]  # y is a slice of x
print(f"y (slice of x): {y}")
print(f"y.base is x: {y.base is x}") # Check if y shares data with x

# Modify an element in the view y
y[0] = 100
print(f"y after changing y[0]: {y}")
print(f"x after changing y[0] (original array affected): {x}")

# Modify part of x that y views
x[1:3] = [10, 11] # Note: x[1] was already changed by modifying y[0]
print(f"x after changing x[1:3]: {x}")
print(f"y after changing x[1:3] (view reflects changes): {y}")
```

### Checking if an Array is a View

You can check if an array is a view of another array using the `.base` attribute. If `y.base` returns the original array `x` (or any array), it means `y` shares its data with `x`. If `y.base` is `None`, then `y` owns its own data.

```python
x = np.arange(10)
y_view = x[1:3]       # Slicing often creates a view
y_copy = x[1:3].copy() # Explicitly making a copy

print(f"y_view.base is x: {y_view.base is x}") # Expected: True
print(f"y_view.base: {y_view.base}")          # Shows the base array

print(f"y_copy.base is x: {y_copy.base is x}") # Expected: False
print(f"y_copy.base: {y_copy.base}")          # Expected: None
```

!!! warning "Implicit vs. Explicit Copying"
    Be mindful of whether an operation returns a view or a copy, especially when modifying arrays. If you need to ensure that the original array is not modified, explicitly create a copy using the `.copy()` method.

# Matplotlib: Creating Visualizations in Python

This chapter introduces Matplotlib, a powerful Python library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

## What You Will Learn
*   How to make quick plots in Python using Matplotlib.
*   How to customize the aesthetic styles of your plots.
*   The fundamental way Matplotlib manages picture components:
    *   Figures as the overall canvas.
    *   Axes as individual plotting areas within a Figure.

## A First Glance at Figures in Python

We've previously discussed how to install Python modules. To get started with Matplotlib, you'll first need to install it (e.g., `pip install matplotlib`). Then, we can import it, typically its `pyplot` interface, along with NumPy for numerical operations and pandas for data manipulation.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import matplotlib as mpl
import pandas as pd # Used in a later example
```

Let's draw our first line. Drawing continuous lines or curves on a computer often involves plotting a series of closely spaced points. This is analogous to how, in physics, perfectly continuous phenomena are often modeled or measured discretely.

We'll generate data for a cosine curve and plot it:

```python
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100) # Generate 100 points from 0 to 10
sinx = np.sin(x)            # Calculate sin(x) for these points
cosx = np.cos(x)            # Calculate cos(x) for these points

plt.plot(x, cosx)
plt.show() # Display the plot
```

Matplotlib has a very natural integration with pandas. A pandas DataFrame can be directly used as a data source for plotting.

Let's load the Iris dataset and try a simple plot using column names:

```python
# Ensure the iris.data file is in a subdirectory named "iris" or provide the correct path.
# irisdata = pd.read_csv("iris/iris.data", header=None)
# For demonstration purposes, let's create a sample DataFrame if the file is not available
data_dict = {
    "sw": np.random.rand(50) * 2 + 5, # Sample sepal width
    "sl": np.random.rand(50) * 3 + 4, # Sample sepal length
    "pw": np.random.rand(50) * 1.5 + 1, # Sample petal width
    "pl": np.random.rand(50) * 2.5 + 0.5, # Sample petal length
    "type": ['Setosa'] * 25 + ['Versicolor'] * 25 # Sample types
}
irisdata = pd.DataFrame(data_dict)
# If using the actual iris.data file, use these lines:
# irisdata = pd.read_csv("iris/iris.data", header=None)
# irisdata.columns = ["sw", "sl", "pw", "pl", "type"]


plt.plot("sw", "sl", data=irisdata)
plt.xlabel("Sepal Width (sw)") # Adding labels for clarity
plt.ylabel("Sepal Length (sl)")
plt.title("Sepal Width vs. Sepal Length (Iris Data)")
plt.show()
```

!!! question "Exercise: Understanding a Messy Plot"
    The code above, when plotting directly from the unsorted Iris dataset (especially if you plot `pl` vs `pw` for all species), might create a messy, tangled line.  
    Why does this happen? Can you modify the plotting command or the data (e.g., by sorting or filtering, as learned in the pandas chapter) to create a more meaningful visualization, perhaps by plotting for a single species or sorting the values?  

## Modifying Line Attributes

The default lines we've drawn might seem basic. Matplotlib offers many ways to add aesthetic elements to make plots more informative and visually appealing. When drawing a line with `plt.plot()`, several attributes are commonly used:

*   **`marker`**: The style of the marker for each data point (e.g., 'o' for circle, 's' for square, '>' for triangle right).
*   **`linestyle`**: The style of the line (e.g., '-' for solid, '--' for dashed, ':' for dotted).
*   **`linewidth`**: The thickness of the line.
*   **`color`**: The color of the line and/or markers (e.g., 'g' for green, 'b' for blue, 'r' for red, or hex codes).

!!! info "Plot Customization Options"
    For a comprehensive list of `plt.plot()` attributes and their possible values, refer to the official Matplotlib documentation:
    [matplotlib.pyplot.plot](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.plot.html)

Let's apply some of these attributes to our sine wave plot:

```python
# Assuming x and sinx are defined as before:
# x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
# sinx = np.sin(x)

plt.plot(x, sinx,
         marker='>', 
         linestyle='--', 
         linewidth=2, 
         color='g')
plt.title("Customized Sine Wave Plot")
plt.xlabel("x")
plt.ylabel("sin(x)")
plt.show()
```

In interactive environments like Jupyter Notebooks or VS Code's Python Interactive window, you can execute multiple `plt.plot()` commands in the same cell to overlay lines on the same Axes.

```python
# Assuming x, sinx, and cosx are defined

plt.plot(x, sinx, 
         marker='>', 
         markersize=5, # Controls the size of the marker
         color='g')
plt.plot(x, cosx, 
         marker='d',  # Diamond marker
         markersize=5, 
         linestyle=':', 
         linewidth=1, 
         color='c')  # Cyan color
plt.title("Sine and Cosine Waves")
plt.xlabel("x")
plt.ylabel("y")
plt.show()
```

When multiple lines are present on a plot, it's crucial to provide a legend to explain what each line represents. You can add a `label` to each `plot` command and then call `plt.legend()`.

```python
# Assuming x, sinx, and cosx are defined

plt.plot(x, sinx, label='sin(x)', marker='>', markersize=5, color='g')
plt.plot(x, cosx, label='cos(x)', marker='d', markersize=5, linestyle=':', linewidth=1, color='c')
plt.legend() # Displays the legend

plt.title("Sine and Cosine Waves with Legend")
plt.xlabel("x")
plt.ylabel("y")
plt.show()
```

Finally, after creating a plot, you might want to save it to a file. This can be done using `plt.savefig()`.

```python
# Assuming the previous plot (sin and cos with legend) is the current active plot

# Re-generate plot for clarity if running this cell independently
plt.plot(x, sinx, label='sin(x)', marker='>', markersize=5, color='g')
plt.plot(x, cosx, label='cos(x)', marker='d', markersize=5, linestyle=':', linewidth=1, color='c')
plt.title("Sine and Cosine Waves with Legend")
plt.xlabel("x")
plt.ylabel("y")

plt.legend() 
plt.savefig('sin_and_cos.png') # Saves the current figure to a PNG file
# You can also save in other formats like PDF, SVG, etc.
# plt.savefig('sin_and_cos.pdf')

# plt.show() # Still useful to display it after saving, if desired
```

!!! note "Saving Figures"
    `plt.savefig()` should typically be called before `plt.show()`. In some backends, `plt.show()` might clear the figure, making subsequent `savefig()` calls produce an empty image.

## Understanding Figure and Axes Organization

Matplotlib organizes pictures using a hierarchy of **Figures** and **Axes**.

*   A **Figure** (`fig`) is the outermost container, like a canvas. It holds all plotting elements (Axes, titles, legends, etc.). You can think of it as the entire window or page on which everything is drawn.
*   An **Axes** (`ax`) is an area within a Figure where the actual plot is drawn (lines, curves, labels, ticks, etc.). A single Figure can contain one or more Axes.

!!! quote "Matplotlib's Layout Terminology"
    The official Matplotlib documentation describes these components: "The Figure is the overall window or page that everything is drawn on... The Axes is the area on which the data is plotted (with functions like `plot()`) and any labels/ticks associated with it."
    For a detailed explanation, refer to:
    [Matplotlib Quick Start Guide - Parts of a Figure](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/quick_start.html#parts-of-a-figure)

Most plotting commands in `matplotlib.pyplot` implicitly operate on the "current" Figure and "current" Axes.

### Implicit Axes Creation with `subplot`

One common way to create and arrange Axes is by dividing the Figure into a grid using `plt.subplot()`. This function creates (or activates) an Axes object at a specified grid location.

The syntax is `plt.subplot(number_of_rows, number_of_columns, index_of_this_plot)`. The index starts from 1.

```python
# Assuming x and sinx are defined

plt.subplot(2, 1, 1) # (2 rows, 1 column, 1st subplot)
plt.plot(x, sinx)
plt.title('sin(x) - Subplot 1')

# plt.subplot(2, 1, 2) # (2 rows, 1 column, 2nd subplot)
# plt.plot(x, cosx, color='r')
# plt.title('cos(x) - Subplot 2')

plt.tight_layout() # Adjusts subplot params for a tight layout
plt.show()
```

!!! question "Exercise: Adding Another Subplot"
    Modify the code above to activate the second subplot position (`plt.subplot(2, 1, 2)`). In this second Axes, plot the cosine curve (`cosx`). Add a title to this second subplot as well.  

!!! question "Exercise: Plotting Circles"
    Please read all questions before you begin plotting.  
    For these exercises, you'll need to generate `x` and `y` coordinates for parts of a circle. Remember that for a unit circle, `x = cos(theta)` and `y = sin(theta)`. You'll need to choose appropriate ranges for `theta` (in radians).  
      
    1.  Draw a plot of a quarter of a unit circle in the first quadrant (x >= 0, y >= 0).  
    2.  Draw a plot of a half unit circle where y >= 0 (upper half).  
    3.  Draw a plot of a full unit circle.  
      
    *Hint: `np.pi` can be used for π. For a quarter circle in the first quadrant, theta might range from 0 to π/2.*  

### Explicit Figure and Axes Creation

While `plt.subplot()` is convenient for creating regular grid layouts, you gain more control by manually creating a Figure object and then adding Axes objects to it. This is often referred to as the "object-oriented" approach in Matplotlib.

*   `fig = plt.figure()`: Creates a new Figure. [Documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.figure.html)
*   `ax = plt.axes()`: Adds an Axes to the current Figure by default, filling the Figure. If no Figure exists, it creates one. This is a simple way to get an Axes. A more explicit way when you have a `fig` object is `ax = fig.add_axes([left, bottom, width, height])` or `ax = fig.add_subplot(1, 1, 1)`. [Documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.axes.html)

Let's create a Figure and an Axes explicitly:

```python
fig = plt.figure() # Create a new Figure
ax = plt.axes()    # Add an Axes to the Figure; it fills the Figure by default

# Let's use a slightly different x range for this example to distinguish
x_plot = np.linspace(0, 10, 1000) # 1000 points for a smoother curve
sinx_plot = np.sin(x_plot)

ax.plot(x_plot, sinx_plot)
ax.set_title("Plot on an Explicitly Created Axes")
ax.set_xlabel("x")
ax.set_ylabel("sin(x)")

# The following line can be useful for understanding object identity in Matplotlib:
# print(f"ID of ax: {id(ax)}, ID of fig.axes[0]: {id(fig.axes[0])}, ID of plt.gca(): {id(plt.gca())}")

plt.show()
```

!!! note "Object Identity and `gca()`"
    The commented-out `print` statement in the code above helps illustrate how Matplotlib manages Axes objects:
    *   `ax`: Refers to the Axes object we explicitly created and assigned to the variable `ax`.
    *   `fig.axes[0]`: Accesses the first Axes object in the list of Axes associated with our `fig` object.
    *   `plt.gca()`: A `pyplot` function that "gets current Axes."
    In the scenario above, `ax`, `fig.axes[0]`, and the Axes returned by `plt.gca()` (after `ax` was created and made current) should all refer to the same Axes object in memory, thus having the same ID.

!!! question "Exercise: Creating Multiple Axes and Checking IDs"
    1. Create a Figure object.  
    2. Use `fig.add_subplot(1, 2, 1)` to create a first Axes object. Store it in a variable `ax1`.  
    3. Use `fig.add_subplot(1, 2, 2)` to create a second Axes object. Store it in a variable `ax2`.  
    4. Print the IDs of `ax1`, `ax2`, and `fig.axes[0]`, `fig.axes[1]`.  
    5. Plot something simple on `ax1` (e.g., `ax1.plot(np.random.rand(10))`).  
    6. Then, call `plt.gca()` and print its ID. Which Axes is currently active?  
    7. Plot something on `ax2`. Call `plt.gca()` again and print its ID.  

!!! question "Exercise: Exploring an Empty Figure"
    1. Create an empty Figure using `fig = plt.figure()`.  
    2. Display it using `plt.show()`. What does it look like?  
    3. Try to call `plt.plot([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])` *after* creating the empty figure but *before* explicitly adding any Axes. What happens? Does Matplotlib create an Axes for you automatically in this case?

## Organization of a Picture in Matplotlib

Understanding how Matplotlib organizes figures and axes is crucial for creating and customizing plots effectively. A `Figure` can be thought of as the overall window or page that everything is drawn on, and it can contain one or more `Axes` objects. An `Axes` is the actual plot—the area where data is plotted with x-axis, y-axis, etc.

### Implicit Figure and Axis Creation

When Python is asked to create an `Axes` object (e.g., by a high-level plotting command like `plt.plot()`), it will first implicitly create a `Figure` object if one doesn't already exist or isn't specified. The `Axes` is then placed within this `Figure`.

You can inspect the identities of these objects to see their relationships:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np # Added for completeness if running standalone

# Example: Create a simple plot, which implicitly creates a Figure and Axes
plt.plot([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])

# Get the current Axes and its Figure
ax = plt.gca()  # Get Current Axes
fig_of_ax = ax.get_figure()

# Get the current Figure directly
current_fig = plt.gcf() # Get Current Figure

print(f"ID of current Axes' Figure: {id(fig_of_ax)}")
print(f"ID of current Figure (gcf): {id(current_fig)}")

# If you had an explicit figure object, e.g., fig_explicit, ax_explicit = plt.subplots()
# print(f"ID of explicit Figure: {id(fig_explicit)}")
# print(f"ID of explicit Axes' Figure: {id(ax_explicit.get_figure())}")
```

!!! warning "Notebook vs. Script Execution"
    Be aware that Matplotlib behaves differently when used in interactive environments like Jupyter notebooks compared to standalone Python scripts. Notebooks often handle figure display implicitly after a cell execution, while scripts typically require an explicit `plt.show()` command to open the plot window.

To get a reference to the current figure at any time, you can use `plt.gcf()` (Get Current Figure). Similarly, `plt.gca()` gets the current axes.

```python
# Get current figure after some plotting has occurred
fig = plt.gcf()
print(f"ID of current Figure (obtained via plt.gcf()): {id(fig)}")
```

!!! question "In-class Exercise: Plot Output"
    Consider where Matplotlib plots are displayed:  
    1. Where does the output of a Matplotlib plot typically appear when you run code in a Python script versus a Jupyter Notebook?  
    2. What command is typically necessary to make a plot visible when running a Python script?  
    

### Best Practices for Plotting in Matplotlib

For clarity, control, and reproducibility, especially in complex visualizations or notebook environments:

!!! note "Key Plotting Strategies"
    *   **Isolate Plotting Logic:** Group all code for generating and customizing a single figure within one code cell (in notebooks) or a dedicated function (in scripts). This improves organization.
    *   **Explicit Creation:** Prefer explicitly creating `Figure` and `Axes` objects using `fig, ax = plt.subplots()`. This provides direct handles (`fig` and `ax`) for manipulation, leading to more readable and maintainable code.
    *   **Manage Figure References:** If you intend to modify a figure created earlier (e.g., in a previous notebook cell or by another function), ensure you maintain and use a reference to its `Figure` object (or `Axes` object).

### Example: Dynamically Modifying a Figure

This example demonstrates how to create an initial plot and then add more data to the same figure and axes. This is common when building up a plot step-by-step or updating it with new information.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Data for the plots
x1 = np.arange(1, 3)
y1 = x1
x2 = np.arange(3, 11)
y2 = x2
x3 = np.arange(11, 21)
y3 = x3

# Create the initial plot.
# The command `plt.scatter` acts on the "current axes."
# If no figure or axes exist, Matplotlib implicitly creates them.
plt.scatter(x1, y1, linewidth=5, label='Dataset 1')

# Get handles to the current figure and axes for further modifications.
# This is useful if you want to ensure subsequent plots go onto this specific figure/axes.
fig = plt.gcf()  # Get Current Figure
ax = plt.gca()   # Get Current Axes

# Add the second dataset to the existing (current) axes
# Using ax.scatter() ensures plotting on this specific Axes object.
ax.scatter(x2, y2, color='r', linewidth=5, label='Dataset 2')

# Add the third dataset to the same existing axes
ax.scatter(x3, y3, color='g', linewidth=5, label='Dataset 3')

# Add a legend to identify the datasets
ax.legend()

# Display the plot (behavior might vary by environment; plt.show() is explicit)
plt.show()
```

!!! info "Pyplot vs. Axes Methods"
    The original notes mentioned comments like `# create an ax< ->fig<->gcf()` and that `plt.scatter(...)` is similar to `# <->ax.scatter <->gca().scatter`.
    This highlights that high-level `plt` functions (like `plt.scatter`) often operate on the "current" figure and axes, which can be accessed via `plt.gcf()` and `plt.gca()`. For more control, especially with multiple subplots or complex figures, using methods directly on an `Axes` object (`ax.scatter()`) is generally preferred over `plt.scatter()`.

### Modifying Axes Attributes

Once you have an `Axes` object (e.g., `ax` from the example above, or if you had `ax = some_figure.gca()`), you can modify its properties such as axis limits, labels, and titles.

```python
# Continuing with 'ax' from the previous example:
ax.set(xlim=(-1, 22),       # Set x-axis limits
       ylim=(-1, 22),       # Set y-axis limits
       xlabel="X-axis",     # Set x-axis label
       ylabel="Y-axis",     # Set y-axis label
       title="A Sine Curve" # Set the title for the axes (as per original notes)
       # Note: The original comment #ｐｌｔ．ｘｌｉｍ refers to plt.xlim functionality
      )

# Re-display the figure to see changes if not automatically updated
# In many environments, modifying 'ax' will update the figure if it's already shown.
# If not, or to be explicit:
plt.show() # Or display(fig) if working with the figure object directly in a notebook
```
!!! quote "Title Note"
    The title "A Sine Curve" is used as specified in the original lecture notes. For the scatter plot data shown in the example, a title like "Multiple Datasets Scatter Plot" might be more descriptive.

!!! info "Matplotlib Figure Anatomy"
    To understand all the components that make up a Matplotlib plot (like Figure, Axes, Axis, Ticks, Spines, Labels, etc.), the official Matplotlib documentation provides an excellent visual guide:
    [Anatomy of a Figure](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/showcase/anatomy.html)

Streaming response: # Matplotlib: Advanced Plotting Techniques

This chapter delves into various advanced plotting techniques using Matplotlib, often complemented by Seaborn, to create insightful data visualizations. We will explore how to generate scatter plots, histograms, and pair plots, which are essential tools in an AI programmer's toolkit for data analysis and presentation.

## Scatter Plots

Scatter plots are fundamental for visualizing the relationship between two numerical variables. They can also effectively represent additional dimensions of data through variations in point size, color, and transparency.

The following example demonstrates creating a scatter plot using the Iris dataset. Here, sepal length and sepal width are plotted, while petal width influences point size and species determines color.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the Iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
features = iris.data.T  # Transpose to get features as rows

# Print the shape of the features array (optional, for verification)
print(features.shape)

# Create the scatter plot
plt.scatter(features[0], features[1],
            alpha=0.2,
            s=100 * features[3],  # Point size based on the fourth feature (petal width)
            c=iris.target,        # Color based on species
            cmap='viridis')       # Colormap for species

# Set axis labels using feature names
plt.xlabel(iris.feature_names[0])  # Sepal length
plt.ylabel(iris.feature_names[1])  # Sepal width
plt.title("Iris Dataset: Sepal Length vs. Sepal Width") # Added a title for clarity
plt.show()
```

!!! note "Scatter Plot Customization"
    Key parameters used in this scatter plot include:
    - `alpha`: Adjusts the transparency of points, useful for overlapping data.
    - `s`: Defines the marker size. Here, it's scaled by the fourth feature of the Iris dataset.
    - `c`: Assigns colors to markers, often based on a categorical variable like `iris.target`.
    - `cmap`: Specifies the colormap to use when `c` is an array of numerical values representing categories.

## Histograms

Histograms are used to visualize the distribution of a single numerical variable. They work by dividing the data range into a series of intervals (bins) and then counting how many values fall into each bin.

This example shows how to plot a histogram for the 'Fe' (Iron) content in a hypothetical 'glass' dataset.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd # Assuming 'glass' might be a Pandas DataFrame

# Note: The 'glass' DataFrame is assumed to be pre-loaded.
# For example:
# data = {'Fe': [0.1, 0.15, 0.12, 0.2, 0.25, 0.18, 0.22, 0.1, 0.13, 0.17, 0.21]}
# glass = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Plotting the histogram for the 'Fe' column
plt.hist(glass["Fe"], bins=30,
         alpha=0.5,
         histtype='stepfilled',
         color='steelblue',
         edgecolor='none')

plt.xlabel("Iron (Fe) Content")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.title("Distribution of Iron Content")
plt.show()
```

!!! info "Understanding Histogram Parameters"
    - `bins`: The number of equal-width intervals or bins.
    - `alpha`: The transparency level of the histogram bars.
    - `histtype`: The type of histogram to draw (e.g., 'bar', 'barstacked', 'step', 'stepfilled').
    - `color`: The color of the histogram bars.
    - `edgecolor`: The color of the edges of the bars. Setting to `'none'` can give a cleaner look for `stepfilled` type.

## Pair Plots

Pair plots, often generated using the Seaborn library, are a powerful tool for exploring relationships between multiple variables in a dataset simultaneously. They create a matrix of plots, where off-diagonal plots are scatter plots between pairs of variables, and diagonal plots typically show the univariate distribution (histogram or density plot) of each variable.

Here's how to create a pair plot for the Iris dataset using Seaborn:

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the Iris dataset using Seaborn
iris_df = sns.load_dataset("iris")

# Display the first few rows of the dataset (optional, for inspection)
print(iris_df.head())

# Create the pair plot
# 'hue' colors data points by the 'species' column
# 'height' (formerly 'size') controls the size of each facet
sns.pairplot(iris_df, hue='species', height=2.5)
plt.suptitle("Pair Plot of Iris Dataset Features by Species", y=1.02) # Add a main title
plt.show()
```

!!! quote "Insight from Pair Plots"
    Pair plots offer a comprehensive overview of pairwise relationships and individual variable distributions. They are particularly useful in the initial stages of exploratory data analysis (EDA) to quickly spot correlations, clusters, and potential patterns within the data. The `hue` parameter is especially valuable for observing how relationships differ across various categories.

Streaming response: # Matplotlib

This chapter delves into Matplotlib, focusing on how to manage multiple plots within a single figure and build complex visualizations. We'll explore various techniques, culminating in a comprehensive example.

## Multiple Axes in One Figure

We've previously learned how Matplotlib handles figures and plots. Now, it's time to take more direct control over the layout and management of multiple axes within a single figure.

Recall that for a quick plot, we might have used `plt.subplot()`. Matplotlib also offers `plt.subplots()` (note the plural 's'), which is a more powerful and commonly used function for creating figures with multiple subplots.

!!! question "Exercise 4.4.1: Understanding `plt.subplot` Return Value"
    What did `plt.subplot` return?  
    (Hint: Consider its typical usage and the object it provides for plotting.)

A simple call to the `plt.subplots()` function returns two objects: a `Figure` object and an `Axes` object (or an array of `Axes` objects). Since plotting commands are methods of an `Axes` object, we use it to draw on the canvas.

```python
# Assuming 'plt' (matplotlib.pyplot) and 'np' (numpy) are already imported
# import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# import numpy as np

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 1000)
sinx = np.sin(x)
cosx = np.cos(x)
expx = np.exp(x)
tanhx = np.tanh(x)

ax.plot(x, sinx)
# To display the plot, you would typically use plt.show() at the end of your script
# or the figure would render automatically in a Jupyter notebook.
```

### Arranging Multiple Subplots

While `plt.subplots()` can create a single figure and axis, its real power shines when creating a grid of subplots. You can specify the number of rows and columns:

```python
fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 2) # Creates a 2x2 grid of subplots
```

!!! question "Exercise 4.4.2: Investigating `axs`"
    What is `axs` in the code `fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 2)`? How would you investigate its type and structure in Python?  

With multiple axes, we can precisely control where each plot is drawn. The `axs` object returned by `plt.subplots(nrows, ncols)` is typically a NumPy array of `Axes` objects. We can unpack this array to assign individual axes to variables:

```python
fig, ((ax1, ax2), (ax3, ax4)) = plt.subplots(2, 2)

# Assuming x, sinx, cosx, expx, tanhx are defined as in the previous example
ax1.plot(x, sinx)
ax1.set_title('sin(x)')

ax2.plot(x, cosx)
ax2.set_title('cos(x)')

ax3.plot(x, expx)
ax3.set_title('exp(x)')

ax4.plot(x, tanhx)
ax4.set_title('tanh(x)')

# Use plt.tight_layout() for better spacing, then plt.show()
# plt.tight_layout()
# plt.show()
```

!!! question "Exercise 4.4.3: Review of Figure/Axes Creation"
    How many distinct methods have we learned so far to create Matplotlib figures and axes?  

### Creating Figures and Axes Sequentially

Another approach is to create a `Figure` object first and then add `Axes` objects to it. This offers fine-grained control over figure properties.

First, create a figure and customize its attributes:
```python
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(2.5, 2.5),       # width and height in inches
                 facecolor='lightskyblue',
                 layout='constrained')     # helps in fitting plots; similar to tight_layout
fig.suptitle('Fig-Ax Figure')
```

Next, add an `Axes` object to the figure and customize it:
```python
ax = fig.add_subplot()
ax.set_title('Axes',
             loc='left',
             fontstyle='oblique',  # 'normal', 'italic', 'oblique'
             fontsize='medium')   # 'small', 'medium', 'large', etc.
# ax.plot(x, sinx) # Example plot
# plt.show()
```

### Mosaic Subplots

For more complex layouts that don't fit a simple grid, Matplotlib offers `subplot_mosaic`. This function allows you to define subplots using a visual, ASCII-art-like representation or a list of lists.

```python
fig, axs = plt.subplot_mosaic([['A', 'right'],
                               ['B', 'right']],
                              figsize=(4, 3),
                              layout='constrained')
```

!!! question "Exercise 4.4.4: Understanding `subplot_mosaic`"
    What is the structure of `axs` when returned by `subplot_mosaic`? Can you summarize the steps to create a plot using this method?  

The `axs` object returned by `subplot_mosaic` is a dictionary where keys are the labels specified in the mosaic layout (e.g., 'A', 'B', 'right'). You can use these keys to access and plot on specific axes:

```python
# Assuming axs is from the subplot_mosaic call above
axs['A'].text(0.5, 0.5,
              'subplot A',
              ha='center',        # Horizontal Alignment
              va='center')        # Vertical Alignment

axs['right'].text(0.5, 0.5,
                  'subplot right',
                  ha='center',
                  va='center')

axs['B'].text(0.5, 0.5,
              'subplot B',
              ha='center',
              va='center')
# plt.show()
```

### Modifying Axes Properties

Once axes are created, you can modify their properties, such as labels, limits, and titles:

```python
# Assuming axs is from the subplot_mosaic example
axs['A'].set_xlabel("x-axis of A")
axs['A'].set_xlim(-2, 3)
axs['B'].set_title('axs[B] title')
# plt.show()
```

### Adding Annotations and Figure Titles

You can add annotations to individual axes and a "super title" (suptitle) to the entire figure. The following example assumes `axs` is a 2D NumPy array (e.g., from `plt.subplots(2, 2)`):

```python
# Re-create a 2x2 grid for this example, if not continuing from above
# fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 2, layout='constrained')

# Assuming axs is a 2x2 array of Axes objects
for row in range(2):
    for col in range(2):
        axs[row, col].annotate(f'axs[{row}, {col}]',
                               (0.5, 0.5), # Coordinates for the text (in data space)
                               ha='center',
                               va='center',
                               fontsize=18,
                               color='darkgrey') # Corrected quote
fig.suptitle('Figure Title via plt.subplots()')
# plt.show()
```

!!! note "Note on `axs`"
    The `axs` object behaves differently depending on how it's created.
    *   `plt.subplots(1, 1)`: `ax` is a single `Axes` object.
    *   `plt.subplots(N, 1)` or `plt.subplots(1, M)`: `axs` is a 1D NumPy array of `Axes`.
    *   `plt.subplots(N, M)` (N>1, M>1): `axs` is a 2D NumPy array of `Axes`.
    *   `plt.subplot_mosaic(...)`: `axs` is a dictionary of `Axes`.

### Precise Axes Placement with `fig.add_axes()`

For ultimate control over subplot positioning and sizing, bypassing automated layout mechanisms, you can use `fig.add_axes()`. This method takes a list `[left, bottom, width, height]` where coordinates are fractions of the figure width and height (ranging from 0 to 1).

```python
# Ensure we have a figure object, possibly clearing an existing one
# if fig exists:
# fig.clf() # Clear current figure
fig = plt.figure()

# Adds an axes that fills the entire figure
ax1 = fig.add_axes([0, 0, 1, 1])
ax1.text(0.5, 0.5, 'Axes [0,0,1,1]', ha='center', va='center', color='blue')

# Adds another axes. These can overlap or be placed arbitrarily.
# The following examples might create axes outside the [0,1]x[0,1] normalized figure area
# or significantly overlap, depending on the values.
# For demonstration:
ax2 = fig.add_axes([0.1, 0.1, 0.5, 0.5]) # An inset axes
ax2.text(0.5, 0.5, 'Axes [0.1,0.1,0.5,0.5]', ha='center', va='center', color='red', fontsize=8)

# The original examples were:
# fig.add_axes([1, 1, 1, 1]) # This would start at the top-right corner and extend out
# fig.add_axes([-1, 0, 1, 2]) # This would start to the left of the figure

# plt.show()
```
!!! warning "Coordinates in `add_axes`"
    Coordinates for `fig.add_axes([left, bottom, width, height])` are typically in normalized figure coordinates (0,0 is bottom-left, 1,1 is top-right). Values outside this range can lead to axes being partially or fully outside the visible figure area, or require careful figure size management.

## Crafting a Complex Example

Now that we are equipped with various tools for creating and managing figures and axes, we are ready to tackle a more complex example. The goal is to construct a specific, detailed picture.

(The raw notes mentioned: "Our goal is to make the following picture. 3. 4. 1. 3. 0. 8. 0. 5". This suggests a visual target, which is not provided here. The numbers might be data or labels from that target image.)

Before writing any code for a complex visualization, it's crucial to analyze its components and structure.

!!! question "Exercise 4.5.1: Deconstructing the Target Figure"
    Imagine you have a complex figure to replicate. How would you approach it? Consider these steps:
    
    1.  Make a skeleton of the target picture (identify main axes, their arrangement).
    2.  Add in the primary data representations (curves, scatter plots, bars, etc.).
    3.  (Optional, if applicable) Fill in areas with colors, add annotations, legends, and fine-tune aesthetics.

Streaming response: # Chapter 5: Machine Learning

!!! info "What You Will Learn"
    *   The general idea of machine learning.
    *   Key terminologies used in the machine learning context.
    *   Several examples using the `scikit-learn` module.

## What Machine Learning Is About

Recall the Cobb-Douglas production function example, where we aimed to find the "best" `𝛼` that gives us the closest estimation of the output for given capital and labor. This is a foundational concept in understanding how machine learning models are developed and refined.

### Key Terminology

Understanding the following terms is crucial in machine learning:

*   **Model**: The equation describing the relationship between variables.
    *   For example, `𝑌=𝐾𝛼𝐿1−𝛼` describes the relationship between `𝑌`, `𝐾`, and `𝐿`.
*   **Target variable**: The variable we want to predict (on the left-hand side) or to know how it is generated.
    *   Also known as the dependent or response variable in econometrics.
*   **Predictors**: Variables used to explain or predict the target variable (on the right-hand side).
    *   Also known as independent or explanatory variables (or covariates) in econometrics.
*   **Parameters**: Symbols whose values are unknown in the model.
    *   For example, `𝛼` in the Cobb-Douglas function.
    *   Once we "know" the parameter values, we can compute the model-implied target variable.
    *   Functional models and their parameters represent our understanding of the world that generates the data.
*   **Estimates**: Because true parameters are unknown, we need to guess their best values (as we did to find `𝛼`).
    *   Even if we find a "best" value, we don't know for certain if the data is actually generated by our chosen model. It's possible our understanding of the world (the model) is not fully correct.
    *   In such cases, parameters from an incorrect model generally cannot be truly "discovered." The best we can achieve for a given model is an **estimate**.

!!! question "Exercise: Identifying Model Components"
    What are the model, variables, and parameters in the following scenarios?  
    
    1.  A research team wants to predict the house price (`𝑃`) for some houses. They collected the area (`𝐴`), the distance to the town center (`𝐷`), the age (`𝐺`), and the materials (`𝑀`) of several houses. They decided to use a complicated relationship:
        `𝑃=𝑓(𝑙(𝐴,𝐷,𝐺,𝑀))`
        where `𝑙(𝐴,𝐷,𝐺,𝑀)=𝑎+𝑏1𝐴+𝑏2𝐷+𝑏3𝐺+𝑏4𝑀`,
        and `𝑓(𝑥)=𝑥` only when `𝑥≥0`; `0` otherwise.
    
    2.  Another team wanted to learn if bond prices (`𝑅`) will go up or down. They collected several variables, but due to privacy issues, they only tell us these are `𝑋1,𝑋2,…,𝑋15`. Their way of prediction is:
        `Prob(𝑅>0) = exp(𝑙(𝑋1,𝑋2,…,𝑋15)) / (1+exp(𝑙(𝑋1,𝑋2,…,𝑋15)))`

### Classification vs. Regression

Machine learning tasks can be broadly categorized based on the nature of the target variable:

*   **Classification**: This task involves predicting discretized target variables.
    *   Examples:
        *   Will bond prices go up or down (instead of how much they will move)?
        *   Will a student pass a course (instead of their exact score)?
        *   Will Trump increase tariffs (instead of the rate by which they are increased)?
*   **Regression**: This task involves predicting the exact value of a continuous target variable.

### Loss Function

A **loss function** is a rule that tells the machine how well the parameters are estimated. It quantifies the difference between the predicted values and the actual values.

*   For example, we have seen the **absolute-error loss**:
    `𝐿(𝒚,ො𝒚) = ෍𝑖 |𝑦𝑖 − ො𝑦𝑖|`
*   Another commonly used error is the **squared-error loss**:
    `𝐿(𝒚,ො𝒚) = ෍𝑖 (𝑦𝑖 − ො𝑦𝑖)²`

We can take derivatives of the loss function with respect to the parameters to find the estimates. This process is also known as "fitting the model to data."

!!! note "Fitting the Model"
    The parameters are implicitly part of the prediction `ො𝑦𝑖`, which is generated by the model using those parameters and the input predictors `𝒙𝒊`.

Machine learning methods are techniques that fit models to data and help find the best data-generating mechanism (represented by parameter estimates) from a class of functions (i.e., functions with the same form but different parameters).

The problem we often want to solve can be simplified and summarized as finding:
`ො𝑦𝑖 = 𝑓(𝒙𝒊; ෡𝜽)`
where `෡𝜽` represents the estimated parameters. In Python, we aim to find such a function `𝑓`.

## The Slope-Interception Example

In Chapter 2.3, we encountered an example of a function that creates another function with a fixed slope and intercept.

```python
def intercept_1():
    a = 1
    def slope_2(x):
        return 2*x + a
    return slope_2

linear_trans = intercept_1()
linear_trans(3)
```

We then had an exercise to modify this function to be more general, allowing arbitrary slope and intercept values:

```python
def intercept_and_slope(a, b):
    # a is the intercept
    def evaluation(x):
        # b is the slope
        return a + b*x  # a and b are nonlocals
    return evaluation
```

Now, let's extend this to fit some data. Consider the following dataset:

| No. | y | x |
|-----|---|---|
| 0   | 0 | 0 |
| 1   | 0 | 1 |
| 2   | 1 | 2 |
| 3   | 3 | 3 |
| 4   | 5 | 4 |

!!! question "Exercise: Fitting a Linear Model"
    1.  Please create a scatter plot to visualize how the data looks.  
    2.  Make use of the `intercept_and_slope` function we wrote, or define new functions, to find the best parameters `a` (intercept) and `b` (slope) for the linear model `𝑦 = 𝑎 + 𝑏𝑥` that fits the provided data.

Streaming response: # Understanding Complex Machine Learning Models and Scikit-learn

For some other machine learning methods beyond linear regression, the function forms are much more complicated, and we sometimes only use pictures to represent them. For example, the neural network model and the classification-and-regression tree model.

## Two Classic Machine Learning Methods

### Neural Network Model Example

Suppose we have 5 observations and 3 explanatory variables. We want to explain one continuous variable `y`. A neural network model can be visualized.

A simple representation:
Inputs `x1`, `x2`, `x3` are processed by a neuron `z1[1]` using a linear function with parameters `a, b1, b2, b3`. The output of this neuron then goes through a ReLU activation function to produce `c1[1]`, which contributes to the final output `f`.

Let’s make the neural network more concrete and complex.
Given inputs `x1`, `x2`, `x3`:
The activations `â1` and `â2` for two neurons in a layer could be calculated as:

`â1 = b1<1> + w11<1>x1 + w12<1>x2 + w13<1>x3`
`â2 = b2<1> + w21<1>x1 + w22<1>x2 + w23<1>x3`

These activations `a1`, `a2` would then be passed through activation functions and potentially further layers to produce the final prediction `ŷ`.

### Tree Model Example

Let’s review the iris data, where flowers are classified into three types. If we only focus on sepal width and sepal length, we could plot these features for a few flowers.

A tree model uses horizontal and vertical lines to split the feature space (the x-space). We can continue this splitting process until we achieve the desired number of sub-spaces, each corresponding to a specific prediction or class.

!!! question "Exercise: Analyzing Neural Network and Tree Models"
    1.  Summarize the model structure and parameters in the previous neural network and tree examples.
    2.  Can you write Python code to implement the functions described for these two models?
    3.  For these models, can you take the derivative of the prediction function with respect to the parameters to help find the optimal parameter estimates?

## The Scikit-learn Module

When model structures are relatively simple, we can write our own functions to represent the model and find the derivatives mathematically for optimization. However, when models become more complex, it is challenging to define the functions and compute derivatives manually.

!!! info "Complex Neural Networks"
    A typical neural network model may contain thousands of cells (neurons) and multiple layers. The complexity can be significant.
    (Based on an idea from a picture modified from: `https://doc.comsol.com/6.2/doc/com.comsol.help.comsol/comsol_ref_definitions.19.050.html`)

In such cases, we turn to the `scikit-learn` module for its robust implementations of various machine learning algorithms.

!!! warning "Installation Note"
    To install scikit-learn, it is recommended to use conda. Avoid installing `sklearn` via pip if you are using Anaconda, as `scikit-learn` is the correct package name.
    ```bash
    conda install scikit-learn
    ```

The machine learning methods in `scikit-learn` follow a very similar API. Let’s start with an example of a tree model to classify the iris flowers.

### Tree Model with Scikit-learn

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn import datasets

# Load the iris dataset
iris = datasets.load_iris()

# Initialize the Decision Tree Classifier
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()

# Fit the model (using all but the last sample for training here as an example)
clf = clf.fit(iris.data[:-1], iris.target[:-1])

# Predict on the training data (excluding the last sample)
res = clf.predict(iris.data[:-1])
```

### Neural Network with Scikit-learn

Let’s try a neural network for a regression task using `scikit-learn`.

```python
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Generate a synthetic regression dataset
X, y = make_regression(n_samples=200, n_features=20, random_state=1)

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=1)

# Initialize the Multi-layer Perceptron Regressor
regr = MLPRegressor(random_state=1, max_iter=2000, tol=0.1)

# Fit the model
regr.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict on the first two samples of the test set
predictions = regr.predict(X_test[:2])

# Score the model on the test set
score = regr.score(X_test, y_test)
```

### Linear Model with Scikit-learn

Of course, `scikit-learn` also provides simple linear models:

```python
from sklearn import linear_model

# Initialize the Linear Regression model
reg = linear_model.LinearRegression()

# Fit the model
reg.fit([[0, 0], [1, 1], [2, 2]], [0, 1, 2])

# Get the coefficients
coefficients = reg.coef_
```

!!! info "Further Learning Resources"
    Scikit-learn offers a wide array of other machine learning models. If you need more references:
    *   "Python Machine Learning" by Sebastian Raschka and Vahid Mirjalili is a great starting point.
    *   Online courses and videos (e.g., from Coursera, fast.ai) can offer a great focus on neural networks.
    *   For more advanced versions of neural networks, consider exploring libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch.

## Model Selection and Cross-Validation

In neural network modeling, we can design our own network architectures. For example, we have seen a simple network with only one layer and one cell, and we can also envision more complex networks with multiple layers and many cells in each layer.

A key question arises: if both simple and complex models are types of neural network models, which one is better for a given task? To answer this, we need to select a specific model configuration. This process is known as the **model selection problem**.

### Cross-Validation

**Cross-validation** is a technique that helps us select the best model by evaluating its performance on different subsets of the data, providing a more robust estimate of its generalization ability.

!!! quote "Insight on Cross-Validation"
    The core idea of cross-validation is to split the training data into multiple folds. The model is trained on some folds and validated on the remaining fold. This process is repeated, and the performance scores are averaged.
    (For visual explanations, refer to the scikit-learn documentation on cross-validation: `https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html`)

!!! question "Exercise: Linear Model Training and Prediction"
    Let’s consider a simple linear model with 10 explanatory variables.
    The data are stored in `sparsedata.csv`. This dataset (presumably 70 observations) already includes the target variable. If we were only interested in these 70 observations, we might not strictly need a predictive model for them.
    However, later on, we collected another 30 observations for which the target variable is unknown. These new explanatory variables are stored in `X_test.csv`.
    Your task will be to train a model on `sparsedata.csv` to help predict the target for the observations in `X_test.csv`.
    *(Further instructions for this exercise would typically follow, detailing steps for loading data, training the model, and making predictions.)*

Streaming response: # Model Refinement and Kaggle Overview

Continuing from our discussion on loading data and basic model training, we now focus on the crucial step of model selection and evaluation. Once features are prepared (e.g., in `X_test.csv`) and a general modeling approach is chosen (like linear models with scikit-learn), we often need to decide on the best specific model structure or parameters.

## Model Selection and Cross-Validation

Model selection involves choosing the best model from a set of candidate models. Cross-validation is a robust technique used to estimate the performance of machine learning models and to prevent overfitting by testing the model on different subsets of the training data.

!!! question "Exercise: Model Selection Using Cross-Validation"
    In this exercise, we'll explore selecting the best model from a predefined set using cross-validation. Assume that not all explanatory variables contribute meaningfully to predicting the target simultaneously. Therefore, we will evaluate the following candidate models:

    *   $y = a + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + b_3x_3 + b_4x_4 + b_5x_5$
    *   $y = a + b_1x_1 + b_3x_3 + b_5x_5 + b_7x_7 + b_9x_9$
    *   $y = a + b_2x_2 + b_4x_4 + b_6x_6 + b_8x_8 + b_{10}x_{10}$
    *   $y = a + b_1x_1 + b_4x_4 + b_8x_8$
    *   $y = a + b_2x_2 + b_6x_6 + b_9x_9$

    Your task is to use cross-validation techniques to select the most suitable model from the list above based on its performance.

### Evaluating Performance on Test Data

After selecting a model using cross-validation, it's essential to evaluate its performance on unseen data. For this purpose, the target variables for the test dataset have been collected and stored in `target_test.csv`.

Use your selected model to make predictions on the 30 observations in the test set and assess how well your model performs.

## A Practical View of Kaggle

Kaggle is a popular platform for data science competitions, datasets, and learning resources. Let’s explore the Optiver Realized Volatility Prediction competition as an example to understand the basic layout and information available on Kaggle.

Navigating a typical Kaggle competition involves understanding several main tabs:

### Key Sections of a Kaggle Competition Page

#### Overview Tab
The **Overview** tab provides the background context for the competition. This includes:

*   A detailed **Description** of the problem.
*   The **Evaluation** metric and rules that determine how submissions are scored.
*   The competition **Timeline**, which is crucial for active participation, detailing start dates, end dates, and any phased deadlines.

#### Data Tab
The **Data** tab is where Kaggle provides the datasets required for training and testing your machine learning models.
*   You'll find descriptions of the data files, their formats, and often a data dictionary explaining the variables.
*   Download links for the datasets are also located here.

!!! info "Handling Diverse Data Formats"
    While CSV files are common, datasets on Kaggle can be stored in various other formats (e.g., Parquet, JSON, HDF5). In such cases, you'll need to learn how to import and process these data formats in Python using appropriate libraries.

Further scrolling down this tab usually reveals detailed file descriptions and download links.

#### Code Tab
The **Code** tab (often called "Notebooks" or "Kernels") showcases public code shared by other participants.
*   This is an excellent resource for learning new techniques, understanding data preprocessing steps, or seeing how others approach the modeling problem.
*   Exploring these notebooks can significantly accelerate your learning in Python and machine learning.

!!! warning "Ethical Code Usage"
    While learning from others' code is encouraged, it is crucial to respect intellectual property. If you use or adapt code from public notebooks, you must clearly acknowledge the original author and source in your own work.

### Learning from the Community

Kaggle fosters a strong community spirit. Beyond code, discussions forums associated with competitions and datasets are valuable for asking questions, sharing insights, and collaborating.

Streaming response: # Python Objects and Classes

This chapter explores the fundamental concept of objects in Python. Everything you interact with in Python is an object, and understanding how to define your own objects using classes is crucial for building complex and well-structured programs.

You will learn about:

*   The nature of Python objects
*   Member attributes and methods
*   The `self` keyword in class methods
*   Special "dunder" (double underscore) methods like `__init__` and `__str__`
*   Using the `@property` descriptor for attribute management

## Python Objects

We learned early on that "everything in Python is an object." An object encapsulates data (attributes) and behavior (methods). Let's delve deeper into this concept.

We've seen how abstraction simplifies programming:

*   Abstraction of basic Python statements forms **loops**.
*   Abstraction of procedures forms **functions**.
*   Now, we introduce another layer: abstraction that helps manage **relationships between data and the operations** on that data, distinguishing variables from the objects they refer to.

Let's consider a few examples of objects we've already encountered:

```python
import pandas as pd

a = int(1.0)  # An integer object
b = pd        # A module object
c = lambda x: x + 1  # A function object (lambdas are functions)
d = type      # A type object (classes are objects too!)
def func():   # A function definition
    pass
```

!!! question "Exercise: Identifying Objects"
    Which of the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `func` in the code above refer to objects?
    <br>
    <br>
    (Hint: The answer might surprise you!)

When you run `type(a)`, Python tells you the type (or class) of the object `a`. If you create another integer, say `num = 100`, `type(num)` will also be `int`. This consistency shows that all integers are created (instantiated) from the same blueprint, the `int` class. This process of creating objects from a class is called **instantiation**.

To create our own types of objects, we first define a **class**. A class definition is similar to a function definition, but we use the `class` keyword instead of `def`. The details within the class body, however, introduce significant new capabilities.

Consider this simple class definition:
```python
class MyInt:
    value = 1  # This is a class attribute
```
Here, `value` is an attribute associated with the `MyInt` class itself.

Now, let's create, or **instantiate**, objects from our custom `MyInt` class.

!!! question "Exercise: Instantiating Classes"
    1.  The built-in `int` is a class. How would you create an integer object from it?
    2.  How would you create an integer-like object using our `MyInt` class definition?
    3.  How would you create another distinct object from our `MyInt` class?
    4.  Modify the `value` of one self-defined integer instance (e.g., `my_int_instance.value = 5`). Does this affect other instances or `MyInt.value`? What if you modify `MyInt.value` directly?
    5.  Are the two self-defined integer objects the same? How can you verify this?

!!! note "Instantiation"
    The creation of distinct objects from a class (e.g., two different `MyInt` objects) is known as **instantiation**. Each object is an **instance** of its class.

## The `__init__` Method: Initializing Instances

In the previous example with `MyInt`, `value = 1` was a **class attribute**. If you define an attribute directly in the class body like this, it's shared among all instances (unless an instance specifically overrides it). Often, we need each instance to have its own separate set of attributes.

To give each instance its own namespace for attributes, we use **instance attributes**. These are typically set within a special method called `__init__`. The `self` keyword is crucial here: it refers to the instance being created.

Instead of a class attribute:
```python
# class MyInt:
#     value = 1 # Class attribute shared by all instances
```
We use `__init__` to create instance attributes:
```python
# class MyInt:
#     def __init__(self, initial_value):
#         self.value = initial_value # Instance attribute, unique to each instance
```

Attempting to use `self` outside of a method context won't work as expected for initializing instances. Python needs the context of a method call to know what `self` refers to.

!!! info "The `self` Keyword"
    `self` is a conventional name for the first parameter of instance methods in Python. It refers to the instance of the class that the method is being called on. When you call a method on an instance (e.g., `my_object.my_method(arg)`), Python automatically passes `my_object` as the `self` argument to `my_method`.

The `__init__` method is a special "dunder" (double underscore) method. It's invoked automatically when you create a new instance of a class.

```python
class MyInt:
    def __init__(self, x):
        # 'self' refers to the new instance being created
        # 'x' is the argument passed during instantiation (e.g., MyInt(5))
        self.value = x  # 'self.value' becomes an instance attribute
```

!!! warning "Importance of `__init__`"
    The `__init__` method is fundamental for object-oriented programming in Python. It initializes the state (attributes) of each new object (instance). Note that `__init__` is a method defined *within* the class.

!!! question "Exercise: Calling `__init__`"
    1.  Can you call the `__init__` method directly from the global environment like a regular function (e.g., `MyInt.__init__(some_instance, value)`)?
    2.  How is the `__init__` method actually invoked when you create an object like `a = MyInt(2)`?

The `__init__` method is often called the **constructor** (though more precisely, `__new__` is responsible for creating the instance, and `__init__` is responsible for initializing it). Its primary role is to set the initial state (attributes) for an instance. It's called when you instantiate the class, using the class name as if it were a function:

```python
# When you write this:
a = MyInt(2)

# Python effectively does something like this:
# 1. Create a new instance of MyInt (let's call it new_instance internally)
# 2. Call MyInt.__init__(new_instance, 2)
# 3. Assign new_instance to 'a'

print(a.value) # Accesses the instance attribute 'value' of object 'a'
```

!!! question "Exercise: The `self` Parameter"
    When we called `a = MyInt(2)`, we only provided one argument (`2`), but the `__init__` method is defined as `def __init__(self, x)`. What happened to the `self` parameter? Did you notice anything unusual about how it's handled?

!!! question "Exercise: Dog Class"
    1.  Define a `Dog` class. Each dog instance should have a `name` (string), an `age` (integer), and a `weight` (float). These should be initialized when a `Dog` object is created using the `__init__` method.
    2.  Create three `Dog` instances:
        *   Spike (age 5, weight 12.5)
        *   Luna (age 3, weight 8.2)
        *   Puppy (age 1, weight 3.1)
    3.  Define a method called `bark` for the `Dog` class. When `bark` is called on a dog instance, it should print the dog's name followed by "says Woof!". For example, if an instance named `spike` calls `bark()`, it should print: `Spike says Woof!`.

## Other Dunder Methods

Python classes come with a variety of special methods, often called "dunder" methods (due to the double underscores surrounding their names), that allow you to customize the behavior of your objects. We've already seen `__init__`. Let's look at a few more.

### `__str__`: String Representation

The `__str__` method defines how an instance of your class should be represented as a string. This is what `print()` and the `str()` built-in function use.

```python
class Cat:
    species = "feline"  # Class attribute

    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name  # Instance attribute
        self.age = age    # Instance attribute

    def __str__(self):
        # Returns a user-friendly string representation of the Cat instance
        return f"A {type(self).__name__} named {self.name}, aged {self.age}."

# Example usage:
tom = Cat('Tom', 3)
print(tom)  # This calls tom.__str__() implicitly
# Output: A Cat named Tom, aged 3.

s = str(tom) # This also calls tom.__str__()
print(s)
# Output: A Cat named Tom, aged 3.
```

### `__iter__` and `__next__`: Making Objects Iterable

To make your object iterable (i.e., usable in a `for` loop or with other iteration contexts), you typically need to implement `__iter__` and `__next__`.
*   `__iter__(self)` should return an iterator object. This is often `self` if the class itself is designed to be its own iterator, or it could be a separate iterator object.
*   `__next__(self)` (if the class is its own iterator) should return the next item in the sequence. When there are no more items, it should raise the `StopIteration` exception.

Here's an example of a class that is iterable because its `__iter__` method returns an iterator for its internal data:
```python
from collections.abc import Iterator # Used for isinstance check

class MyIterable:
    def __init__(self, *args):
        self.data = args  # Stores the data to be iterated over

    def __iter__(self):
        # This __iter__ method returns a standard iterator for the tuple self.data
        # It does not make MyIterable instances themselves iterators,
        # but it makes them iterable.
        print("MyIterable.__iter__ called, returning an iterator for self.data")
        return iter(self.data) 

# Example usage:
i1 = MyIterable(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Get an iterator from our iterable object
my_iterator = iter(i1) # This calls i1.__iter__()

print(f"Is the result of iter(i1) an Iterator? {isinstance(my_iterator, Iterator)}")

# Iterate using a for loop (which implicitly calls iter() then next())
print("\nIterating through MyIterable using a for loop:")
for item in i1:
    print(item)
```

The following is a conceptual illustration of how a `__next__` method would function, typically as part of an iterator class (which `__iter__` would return).
Note: The original raw notes presented `__next__(self, i)`, which is non-standard. `__next__` only takes `self`.

```python
class MyIteratorConcept:
    # This class is intended to be an iterator itself.
    # It would need an __init__ method to receive data and initialize self.counter.
    # For example:
    # def __init__(self, data_collection):
    #     self.data = data_collection
    #     self.counter = 0
    #
    # def __iter__(self):
    #     return self # An iterator returns itself from __iter__

    # The __next__ method as described in the raw notes, adapted for typical use:
    # (Original raw notes had 'def __next__(self, i):')
    def __next__(self): 
        # Assume self.data and self.counter are initialized in __init__
        if not hasattr(self, 'data') or not hasattr(self, 'counter'):
             raise TypeError("MyIteratorConcept not properly initialized with data and counter.")

        if self.counter < len(self.data):
            ans = self.data[self.counter]
            self.counter += 1
            return ans
        else:
            # No more items, signal completion
            raise StopIteration()
```

!!! note "Standard `__next__` Signature"
    The standard signature for the `__next__` method is `def __next__(self):`. The parameter `i` seen in the original raw notes for `__next__(self, i)` is not standard and would typically not be present. The logic of `__next__` is to return the subsequent item from the collection it iterates over or raise `StopIteration`.

## The `@property` Descriptor

In previous exercises, such as setting a dog's age, you might have set attributes by direct assignment:
```python
# Hypothetical simple Dog class
# class Dog:
#     def __init__(self, name, age):
#         self.name = name
#         self.age = age # Age can be set to anything directly

# my_dog = Dog("Buddy", 5)
# my_dog.age = -2 # Problem: Age can be set to an invalid value!
```
However, many attributes have inherent constraints or require computation when accessed or modified. For example, a dog's age cannot be negative. To protect attributes from being set to meaningless or invalid values, and to add custom logic around getting, setting, or deleting attributes while maintaining a simple attribute-access syntax, Python provides the `@property` descriptor.

Let's consider a `Dog` class where we want to control how the `age` attribute is handled. The raw lecture notes provided the following starting point, which illustrates the problem:
```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, initial_age):
        # For now, let's directly assign it, even if potentially negative.
        # We will see how @property helps manage this.
        self.age = initial_age 
        print(f"Dog instance created with age: {self.age}")

# Example demonstrating the issue without @property:
xiaobai = Dog(2)      # Output: Dog instance created with age: 2
xiaohuang = Dog(-1)   # Output: Dog instance created with age: -1 
                      # This is undesirable, as age shouldn't be negative.
```
The `@property` decorator allows us to define methods that are accessed like attributes (e.g., `my_dog.age`) but trigger custom code for getting, setting, and deleting their values. This provides a way to implement validation, computation, or side-effects when attributes are manipulated.

*(The lecture notes would typically continue here to show how to implement `@property` with its associated setter and deleter methods to manage the `age` attribute correctly.)*

# LLMs and RAG

## What You Will Learn

This chapter will guide you through several key aspects of working with Large Language Models (LLMs):

*   Converse with LLMs directly from Python.
*   Understand some very basic mechanisms of how LLMs operate.
*   Learn about the RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) technique.
*   Explore some practical examples of RAG.

## Calling LLM APIs

We are all familiar with conversing with Large Language Models (LLMs) on their websites through dialogue boxes. While convenient, this method can be restrictive, especially when dealing with sensitive information or requiring repetitive tasks.

For instance, imagine you're editing a statement of purpose for a university application. This document likely contains personal information you wouldn't want an LLM to retain or infer patterns from. If you need several rounds of discussion with the LLM to refine your statement for clarity and impact, you'd have to manually replace sensitive details like names with placeholders in each interaction.

Using Python to call LLM APIs offers a more streamlined and secure approach. You can define variables for sensitive data and pass a modified, privacy-preserving version of your text to the model.

```python
name = "Tony"
message = "Hello, {name}!"
# print(message.format(name=name))
```

### Environment Setup

To begin, let's prepare our Python environment. You'll need to install the following modules:

*   `langchain`: A framework that simplifies calling LLMs from Python.
*   `langchain-deepseek`: A specific integration for DeepSeek APIs.
*   `textwrap`: A utility for formatting output neatly.
*   `dotenv`: A module to securely manage API keys by storing them in a `.env` file.

!!! info "DeepSeek API Key"
    You will need a DeepSeek API key.
    1. Create a DeepSeek account.
    2. Log in to [https://platform.deepseek.com/usage](https://platform.deepseek.com/usage) to generate an API key.
    3. For this class, you may use a provided key. After the class, if you wish to continue practicing, you can add funds to your account (which may be eligible for reimbursement for course-related practice).

### Example: Talking to DeepSeek from Python

Let's see how to communicate with the DeepSeek LLM using Python.

```python
from langchain_deepseek import ChatDeepSeek
import textwrap

# For more details, refer to the Langchain documentation:
# https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/deepseek/

llm = ChatDeepSeek(model="deepseek-chat")

messages = [
    ("system", "You are a helpful editor. Help me polish the application."),
    ("human", "My name is {myname}. I’m writing to apply to your university."),
]

# Note: To run this, you would replace {myname} or format it appropriately.
# For simplicity in this example, we'll assume it's a placeholder.
# A more complete example would be:
# my_name_value = "Your Actual Name"
# messages = [
#     ("system", "You are a helpful editor. Help me polish the application."),
#     ("human", f"My name is {my_name_value}. I’m writing to apply to your university."),
# ]


resp_msg = llm.invoke(messages)

# To display the response content:
# print(textwrap.fill(resp_msg.content, width=70))
```

**Sample Model Output:**

If you were to run the code (after setting up your API key and properly formatting the `myname` variable), you might receive a response similar to this:

```
Here’s a polished and professional version of your application opening:
---
**Subject:** Application for Admission

Dear [Admissions Committee/Recipient’s Name],

My name is [Your Name], and I am writing to express my sincere interest in
applying to [University Name] for [program name, if applicable].
[Optional: Add 1–2 sentences about why you’re drawn to the university or
program—e.g., "I am..."]
```

## Conversation with LLMs

A true conversation differs from a one-off question-and-answer exchange because the LLM needs to "remember" the context of the preceding dialogue. To achieve this, we must create a continuous flow of interaction and have a system for storing the conversation history.

### Message Types

When we communicate with LLMs, our messages convey different types of information, as seen in the previous example:

*   **System Message**: Provides background knowledge, instructions, or a persona for the LLM (e.g., "You are a helpful editor.").
*   **Human Message**: Contains our actual questions, prompts, or inputs to the LLM (e.g., "My name is {myname}...").
*   **AI Message**: Represents the response generated by the LLM.

We will store all this information, typically in a list, to maintain the conversational thread.

### Storing Conversation History

Let's initialize a list to store our chat history:

```python
# (Assuming HumanMessage and AIMessage are imported from langchain.schema)
# from langchain.schema import HumanMessage, AIMessage
chat_history = []
```

!!! question "Exercise: Handling Open-Ended Conversations"
    If we are not sure when the conversation will end (e.g., the user can type "quit" to exit), how can we structure the Python code to handle this continuous interaction?

    This typically involves a loop that continues until a specific exit condition is met.

### Implementing a Multi-Round Discussion

Here's how you can set up a loop for an ongoing conversation with an LLM:

```python
# (Ensure llm is defined, e.g., from the previous DeepSeek example)
# from langchain_deepseek import ChatDeepSeek
# from langchain.schema import HumanMessage, AIMessage
# llm = ChatDeepSeek(model="deepseek-chat")
# chat_history = [
#     ("system", "You are a helpful conversational AI.") # Initial system message if needed
# ]
# Or using HumanMessage/AIMessage objects if you imported them
# from langchain.schema import SystemMessage
# chat_history = [
#    SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful conversational AI.")
# ]


while True:
    query = input("You: ")
    if query.lower() == "quit":
        break
    
    # Add user's message to history
    # If using tuples:
    chat_history.append(("human", query))
    # If using Message objects:
    # chat_history.append(HumanMessage(content=query))
    
    # Get LLM's response
    result = llm.invoke(chat_history)
    response = result.content
    
    # Add LLM's response to history
    # If using tuples:
    chat_history.append(("ai", response))
    # If using Message objects:
    # chat_history.append(AIMessage(content=response))
    
    print(f"AI: {response}")

```

!!! note "Message Objects"
    In `langchain`, messages are often represented by specific classes like `SystemMessage`, `HumanMessage`, and `AIMessage` imported from `langchain.schema` or `langchain_core.messages`. The example above uses tuples `("type", "content")` for simplicity, which `ChatDeepSeek` and other Langchain chat models can often interpret directly. However, using the explicit message objects is a more robust practice.

## What LLMs Are About

Based on our experiences, LLMs primarily act as sophisticated chatbots. But how do they manage to "understand" and process human language?

!!! question "Exercise: LLM Language Processing Steps"
    In Chapter 2, we learned how pictures are stored in a computer (as pixel data). In Chapter 6, we saw how numeric covariates are used to predict responses in statistical models. Considering this, what steps do you think LLMs take to analyze human languages?

    Think about how text, which is symbolic, can be converted into a format that a mathematical model can process.

### The Recursive Neural Network (RNN) Structure

One of the foundational architectures that enabled advancements in processing sequential data like text is the Recursive Neural Network (RNN), and its more advanced variants like LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory networks).

!!! info "Visualizing RNNs/LSTMs"
    The structure of these networks is designed to handle sequences by maintaining a state or "memory" of previous elements in the sequence.
    *Source for further reading and diagrams: [Understanding LSTMs by Christopher Olah](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/)*

    A key idea is that the network's output at a given step depends not only on the current input but also on what it has processed previously.

### The Concept of Embedding

The most crucial concept for understanding how LLMs process language is **embedding**. Embedding is the process of converting textual units (words, phrases, sentences, paragraphs, or even entire documents) into numerical representations, specifically vectors in a high-dimensional space.

These vectors capture the semantic meaning and context of the text, such that similar words or phrases have similar vector representations. This numerical format is what allows neural networks to perform mathematical operations on language.

!!! quote "Insight: Embedding is Key"
    Embedding is the bridge that allows computational models to "understand" and manipulate the nuances of human language by translating it into the language of mathematics (vectors).

    *Further context on embeddings can also be found in resources like the previously mentioned article by Christopher Olah.*

!!! question "Exercise: The Core Task of LLMs"
    Technically, what are LLMs doing when they generate text or answer questions? What is their fundamental objective at a high level?

    Consider the input they receive (often a prompt and context) and the output they produce.

## Understanding Large Language Models (LLMs)

### Technically, What Are LLMs Doing?
Large Language Models (LLMs) are sophisticated neural networks designed to process and generate human language. They function by taking embedded language inputs (text converted into numerical representations) and producing responses. The nature and quality of these responses are heavily influenced by the input messages, often referred to as prompts.

!!! warning "A Challenge with LLMs: Hallucinations"
    A common issue with general-purpose LLMs is their tendency to "hallucinate," meaning they may generate incorrect, nonsensical, or fabricated information. A well-known example of this is the generation of non-existent academic references.

To address such limitations and enhance the reliability of LLM outputs, techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have been introduced.

## Enhancing LLM Responses with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAG is a technique designed to provide LLMs with more relevant and factual information when responding to queries. By augmenting the input prompt with information retrieved from a trusted knowledge base, RAG aims to ground the LLM's responses in verifiable data, thereby reducing hallucinations and improving accuracy.

### The RAG Prompt Structure

The core idea of RAG is to modify the user's prompt to include relevant documents or pieces of information. A generalized structure for such a prompt might look like this:

```text
combined_input = (
    "Here are some documents that might help answer the question: "
    + doc_info
    + "\n\nRelevant Documents: \n"
    + "\n\n"
    + "\n".join([doc for doc in relevant_docs]) # Placeholder for actual document joining
    + "\n\nPlease provide an answer based only on the provided documents. If the "
    + "answer is not found in the documents, respond with 'I'm not sure'."
)
```

!!! note "Key Question in RAG"
    A crucial aspect of RAG is determining how to select the most relevant information from a large corpus of documents to include in the prompt.

### Addressing LLM Knowledge Gaps: An Example

Consider a scenario where we are interested in Chinese literature, specifically the classic novel "侠客行" (Ode to Gallantry). Suppose we have the text of this novel stored locally.

If we ask a general LLM about specific details, like identifying a main character from a famous scene, it might not have sufficient knowledge or recall. For instance, while some advanced models like DeepSeek might provide a correct answer, others like ChatGPT might struggle without specific context.

This highlights the need for LLMs to access more background information (context). With RAG, we can provide this context directly. Even though we can, in theory, pass large amounts of raw text to an LLM, it's inefficient and doesn't guarantee that the LLM will focus on the most pertinent sections. RAG helps the system (and ultimately the LLM) decide which parts of the text are most relevant to a given question.

### Implementing RAG: Processing Text Data for RAG

Let's walk through an example of preparing text data for a RAG system. We'll use the novel "侠客行" as our source document.

**Assumptions:**
*   The text file `侠客行.txt` is located at `E:\courses\2025S Python\data7\侠客行.txt`.
*   We will store our processed data (vector database) in `E:\courses\2025S Python\data7\chroma_db`.

#### Loading and Splitting Documents

First, we load the document and split it into smaller, manageable chunks.

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain_text_splitters import CharacterTextSplitter
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings # Updated import

file_path = r"E\courses\2025S Python\data7\侠客行.txt"
loader = TextLoader(file_path, encoding="gb18030")
documents = loader.load()

text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=250, chunk_overlap=0)
docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)
```

#### Generating Embeddings

Next, we convert these text chunks into numerical representations (embeddings) using an embedding model.

```python
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(
    model="text-embedding-3-small"
)
# Update to a valid embedding model if needed and ensure API key is configured
```

!!! info "Embeddings"
    Embeddings capture the semantic meaning of text, allowing us to measure similarity between different text passages.

#### Storing Embeddings in a Vector Database

The embedded text chunks are then stored in a vector database. We will use Chroma for this purpose. This database, often referred to as a "vector store," allows for efficient similarity searches.

```python
from langchain_community.vectorstores import Chroma

db_directory = r"E\courses\2025S Python\data7\chroma_db"

# Create and persist the vector store
db = Chroma.from_documents(
    docs,
    embeddings,
    persist_directory=db_directory
)
```

#### Retrieving Relevant Documents

When a user asks a question, we query the vector store to find the most relevant document chunks.

```python
query = "谁是狗杂种" # "Who is Gou Zazhong (a character name)?"

# Retrieve relevant documents based on the query
retriever = db.as_retriever(
    search_type="similarity_score_threshold",
    search_kwargs={"k": 3, "score_threshold": 0.3},
)
relevant_docs = retriever.invoke(query)
```

#### Constructing the Prompt with Retrieved Context

Finally, we combine the original query with the retrieved relevant text chunks to form the augmented prompt for the LLM.

```python
# Assuming 'query' and 'relevant_docs' are defined as above
combined_input = (
    query
    + "\n\n"
    + "\n\n".join([doc.page_content for doc in relevant_docs])
)

# This combined_input would then be sent to an LLM.
# For example:
# from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
# llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo") # Or your preferred model
# response = llm.invoke(combined_input)
# print(response.content)
```

!!! quote "Insight"
    By providing these relevant snippets directly within the prompt, the LLM can generate an answer that is more accurate and contextually grounded.

### Further Steps for RAG

The RAG process described above is a foundational example. There are many ways to extend and improve upon this:

*   **Advanced Text Splitting:** Exploring different strategies for dividing documents into chunks.
*   **Diverse Embedding Models:** Utilizing various models to create text embeddings, potentially tailored to specific domains.
*   **Sophisticated Retrieval Methods:** Implementing more complex techniques to find relevant information, beyond simple similarity search.
*   **Integrating Various LLMs:** Adapting the RAG pipeline to work with different Large Language Models.
*   **Conversational RAG:** Building systems that can maintain context over multiple turns of a conversation using RAG.

!!! info "Further Reading Recommendation"
    For those interested in diving deeper into RAG, exploring resources from experts in the field is highly recommended. (The original notes mention "this guy!", likely referring to a specific content creator or researcher whose materials would be beneficial.)

## A Big Recall: Revisiting Fundamental AI Applications

# Ensure ffmpeg is installed: conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg
# Ensure openai-whisper is installed: pip install openai-whisper

model = whisper.load_model("base")
# Assuming 'audio.m4a' is in the same directory or provide full path
# result = model.transcribe(audio="audio.m4a", fp16=False)
# print(result["text"])
```
!!! note "Code Execution Note"
    The code above sets up the model. To run the transcription, you would uncomment the `transcribe` line and ensure an audio file named `audio.m4a` is available. The output `result` is a dictionary, and `result["text"]` contains the transcribed text.

### Example: Picture Recognition (OCR with EasyOCR)

This example shows how to extract text from an image using EasyOCR.

```python
import easyocr # pip install easyocr

reader = easyocr.Reader(['en'], gpu=False) # Initialize for English, CPU-only
# result = reader.readtext('F:/2025S Python/00 -introduction/good.png', detail=0)
# print(result)
```
!!! note "Code Execution Note"
    To run this, uncomment the `readtext` line and ensure an image file is present at the specified path `'F:/2025S Python/00 -introduction/good.png'`. `detail=0` returns a list of strings. The variable `result` will hold the extracted text.

### Example: Picture Generation (OpenAI DALL-E)

This example illustrates how to generate an image using OpenAI's DALL-E model via its API.

```python
from openai import OpenAI # pip install openai
import os

# Ensure your OpenAI API key is set as an environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY
# OPENAI_API_KEY = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY") 
# client = OpenAI(api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY)

# response = client.images.generate(
#  model="dall-e-2",
#  prompt="driving in Ames in autumn",
#  size="1024x1024",
#  quality="standard",
#  n=1,
# )
# print(response.data[0].url)
```
!!! note "Code Execution and API Key"
    To execute this code:
    1.  Ensure the `openai` library is installed.
    2.  Set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` as an environment variable or directly in the code (less secure).
    3.  Uncomment the lines to create the client and make the API call.
    The output will be a URL pointing to the generated image.

# Environment Setup: Dependencies

This section outlines the required Python libraries and their specific versions for the AI programming course projects and examples. Ensuring these dependencies are installed in your environment is crucial for compatibility and reproducibility.

!!! info "Managing Dependencies"
    It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment (e.g., using `venv` or `conda`) to manage these project-specific dependencies. This helps avoid conflicts with other Python projects on your system.
    You can typically install these dependencies from a `requirements.txt` file using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
