# Environment Setup: Dependencies

This section outlines the required Python libraries and their specific versions for the AI programming course projects and examples. Ensuring these dependencies are installed in your environment is crucial for compatibility and reproducibility.

!!! info "Managing Dependencies"
    It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment (e.g., using `venv` or `conda`) to manage these project-specific dependencies. This helps avoid conflicts with other Python projects on your system.
    You can typically install these dependencies from a `requirements.txt` file using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
