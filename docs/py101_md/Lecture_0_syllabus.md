## Assignments and Grading

Your final grade will be determined by your performance in the following areas:

1.  **Homework Assignments (up to 12):**
    -   Assignments must be completed individually.
    -   Collaboration on concepts with classmates, friends, and online forums is permitted and encouraged.
    -   **Direct copying ("copy-paste") of solutions from any source is strictly prohibited.**
2.  **Mid-term Exam (Written):**
    -   The specific format will be announced later.
    -   Focuses on the derivations of machine learning algorithms.
    !!! danger "Academic Integrity Warning: Mid-term Exam"
        NO CHEATING IS TOLERATED. Failure to comply with this moral requirement LEADS TO A FAILURE OF THIS COURSE.  
3.  **Final Exam (Programming Skills - TBD):**
    -   This component is to be determined.
    -   Will assess Python programming skills.
    !!! danger "Academic Integrity Warning: Final Exam"
        NO CHEATING IS TOLERATED. Failure to comply with this moral requirement LEADS TO A FAILURE OF THIS COURSE.  
4.  **Group Class Project:**
    -   Requires an in-class presentation before the final exam period.
    -   Teams should consist of 5-8 students.

### Grading Breakdown (Tentative)
- Attendance and Homework: 40%
- Mid-term Exam: 10%
- Final Exam: 20%
- Group Project: 30%

## Course Policies

### Homework Submission
- You are encouraged to seek limited assistance from the instructor or TA for assignments.
- Discussions with fellow students are allowed, but the final submission must be your own independent work. This is a matter of academic integrity.
- All submitted work (text, symbols, code) must be original. Do not submit work copied from others.
- Ensure your homework files are named clearly for easy identification by graders.

!!! note "Mandatory Integrity Statement for Homework"
    Each student must include the following statement with their submitted code:
    
    I have neither given nor received unauthorized assistance on this assignment.  

### Classroom Etiquette
- Maintain a professional demeanor in all interactions with peers, faculty, and staff.
- The instructor aims to start and end classes promptly.
- **Arrivals/Departures:**
    - If you arrive late, please enter and find a seat quietly to minimize disruption.
    - If you need to leave early, inform the instructor in advance and exit unobtrusively.
- **Recording:** No unauthorized audio or video recording of lectures is permitted.

### Late Submissions
- Homework submitted after the deadline will generally not be accepted.
- However, your lowest homework grade will be automatically dropped from the final calculation.

### Academic Integrity: Cheating and Plagiarism
- **Homework:** No "copy-paste" from others’ homework is allowed.
- **Exams:**
    !!! danger "Zero Tolerance for Cheating"
        NO CHEATING IS TOLERATED for both the mid-term and final exams. Failure to comply with this fundamental moral requirement WILL RESULT IN A FAILING GRADE FOR THE ENTIRE COURSE.

# Course Policies and University Regulations

This section outlines important university policies regarding academic integrity, grading, attendance, and examinations. Please review these carefully.

!!! danger "Academic Integrity and Course Failure"
    Failure to comply with fundamental moral requirements, particularly regarding academic honesty on exams, **WILL RESULT IN A FAILING GRADE FOR THE ENTIRE COURSE.**

## Grading

### Grade Confirmation
Your grades, including those for homework assignments and exams, cannot be modified once they are confirmed. If you have any questions or concerns about your grades, please contact the TA or the instructor in a timely manner.

## Attendance

### Absence Policy
Unauthorized absences carry severe penalties. Please be aware of the following university regulation:

!!! quote "University Regulation on Absences"
    “在长学期连续旷一门课 6次以上（含 6次）或随机抽查点名旷课 3次以上（含 3次） ，取消其参加该课程的期末考试资格，成绩以 0分登记。”

    **Translation (for clarity):** "During a long semester, if a student is absent from a course for 6 or more consecutive sessions, or is absent 3 or more times during random roll calls, they will be disqualified from taking the final exam for that course, and their course grade will be recorded as 0."

## Examinations

### Article 25: Student Course Examinations
The university has specific regulations regarding course examinations:

!!! info "University Examination Regulations (Article 25)"
    经济学科所有统开课和专业课（选修、必修） （含辅修）应安排时间、地点进行期中考试和期末考试，期中考试可以以闭卷笔试、半开卷笔试、开卷笔试方式进行； 期末考试必须采用闭卷笔试方式； 短学期课程可以采用考查方式。

    根据学校要求，对期末考试，任课教师考前须提交命题审核表，同时出 A、B 两套试题（ A、B 卷重复率不高于 20%，与近三年的试卷重复率不超过 20%） 。所有课程考试不得 由教学助理或其他人代出试卷。

**Summary of Key Points (Translation for clarity):**

*   All unified and specialized courses in Economics (elective, compulsory, and minor) must schedule mid-term and final exams.
*   Mid-term exams can be closed-book, semi-open-book, or open-book written tests.
*   **Final exams must be closed-book written tests.**
*   Short-semester courses may use an assessment (考查) method.
*   For final exams, instructors must submit an exam question review form beforehand and prepare two versions of the exam (Set A and Set B).
*   The overlap between Set A and Set B should not exceed 20%.
*   The overlap with exam papers from the past three years should not exceed 20%.
*   Exam papers for all courses must not be prepared by teaching assistants or other individuals on behalf of the instructor.
