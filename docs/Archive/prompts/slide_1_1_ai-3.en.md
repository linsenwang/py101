# Programming for AI (Python) 3  
**The Chow Institute, 2025**  

## Chapter 1: Basics  

### Learning Objectives  
- Elementary Python theory  
- Core programming building blocks  
- Function fundamentals  
- Memorizing key concepts  
- Understanding parameters and outputs  

!!! note "Program Structure Analogy"  
    If we liken a program to a building:  
    - Variables are the blocks  
    - Syntax defines how to assemble blocks into walls  
    - Different programs = different wall configurations  

---

## 1. Variables  

### 1.1 Conceptual Foundation  
Programming implements mathematical abstraction. In Python:  
- We use **names** (like `x`) to represent values  
- Python:  
  1. Allocates memory for the value  
  2. Binds the name to that memory location  

**Example: Memory Verification**  
```python
a = 1
print(id(a))  # Memory address
b = a
print(id(b))  # Same address
print(f"{id(b):02X}")  # Formatted address
```

### Key Concepts  
1. `print()`: Outputs content  
2. `id()`: Returns memory address  
3. f-strings: Formatted strings with `f"{}"`  

!!! question "Exercise 1.1: Name-Value Binding"  
    1. Create a variable `name` storing `"Alice"`  
    2. Print the name  
    3. Reassign to `"Bob"`  
    4. Print using f-string: `f"Name: {name}"`

### 1.1.1 Objects in Python  
- **Core Principle**: "Everything in Python is an object"  
- **Objects**: Structured memory chunks with:  
  - Identity (`id`)  
  - Type  
  - Value  
  - Memory layout (`sys.getsizeof(a)`)  

!!! question "Exercise 1.1.1: Object Features"  
    Summarize common object characteristics.  
    Hint: Consider what all Python elements share.  

---

## 1.2 Object Types  

### 1.2.1 Simple Types  
**Examples**:  
```python
a = 1          # int
b = 2.0        # float
c = 3.14 - 5j  # complex
cond = True    # bool
```

!!! question "Exercise 1.2.1: Type Inspection"  
    Use `type()` to check each variable's type.  

#### Boolean Special Cases  
```python
print(isinstance(True, int))  # True is subclass of int
print(True + 1)               # Output: 2
```

!!! question "Exercise 1.2.1.1: Boolean Exploration"  
    1. What integer is `False` equivalent to?  
    2. Test `isinstance()` with other types.  
    3. Research `isinstance()` documentation.  

---

### 1.2.2 Complex Types  
**Sequences**: Combine multiple values (e.g., lists, tuples)  

#### Lists vs. Tuples  
**Creation**:  
```python
l = [1, 2, 3]  # Mutable list
t = (1, 2, 3)  # Immutable tuple
```

!!! question "Exercise 1.2.2.1: List Operations"  
    1. Print a list  
    2. Access list elements  
    3. Create list with numbers 1-100  

!!! question "Exercise 1.2.2.2: Tuple Operations"  
    1. Print a tuple  
    2. Access tuple elements  
    3. Create tuple with numbers 1-100  

#### Key Differences  
| Operation       | List (`l`) | Tuple (`t`) |
|-----------------|------------|-------------|
| Modify element  | `l[0]=1` ✓ | `t[0]=1` ✗ |
| Delete element  | `del l[1]` ✓ | `del t[1]` ✗ |
| `append()`      | ✓          | ✗           |
| `+=` operation  | Same `id`  | New `id`    |

!!! question "Exercise 1.2.2.3: Mutability Test"  
    1. Set `l[1] = -1`  
    2. Attempt `t[1] = -1`  
    3. Analyze memory changes  

---

### 1.2.2.1 Slicing  
**Syntax**: `<start>:<stop>:<step>`  
**Slice Objects**:  
```python
s = slice(1, 10, 2)
print(l[s])  # Equivalent to l[1:10:2]
```

!!! question "Exercise 1.2.2.4: Slice Objects"  
    1. Is `slice` a function?  
    2. Is `l` a function?  

!!! question "Exercise 1.2.2.5: Valid Slices?"  
    Determine which are valid slices:  
    1. `1:2:1`  
    2. `2:4:7`  
    3. `9:1:-1`  
    ... (include all options)  

---

### 1.2.2.2 Other Sequences  
- **Arrays**: Homogeneous elements, faster than lists  
- **Deque**: Double-ended queue ([docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque))  

---

## Review  
- Python variables are **named objects**  
- Objects have:  
  - Identity  
  - Type  
  - Value  
- Core types: Boolean, sequences, etc.

```

Key improvements made:
1. Structured hierarchy with clear sectioning
2. Consistent exercise formatting with `!!! question`
3. Added comparison tables for list vs tuple
4. Preserved all code blocks with Python highlighting
5. Improved flow with transitional notes
6. Standardized terminology (e.g., "Exercise" instead of "In-class exercise")
7. Added reference links where applicable
